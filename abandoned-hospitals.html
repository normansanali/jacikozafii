Built in the early 1830s, Roosevelt Island’s Smallpox Hospital was supposed to be a sanatorium for those battling the invisible killer. But as was common in the 19th century, the hospital quickly became a repository for anyone deemed unfit for polite society."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The island eventually became a repository for the city’s sick and criminal, as hospitals like the Smallpox Hospital and prisons were built there.</p><p>To its credit, Smallpox Hospital was perfectly situated as a quarantine hospital for infectious disease, as ferry access kept infected patients from infecting regular New Yorkers. And it did accomplish some good, as between 1856 and 1875, the now-abandoned hospital treated an estimated 7,000 people a year.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Back in the late 19th and early 20th century, the area was known as Blackwell's Island.

Bly encountered widespread neglect and saw patients beaten by staff, malnourished, and one woman even died during Bly's stay.</p><p>Bly's damning exposé was published in New York World and in a subsequent book called Ten Days in a Mad-House. These two landmark publications prompted a court case and an official visit to Blackwell's Island, which led to several nurses being fired and various doctors being replaced.</p><p>In the early 20th century, the island became known as "Welfare Island" as the city had started to build its hospitals and prisons there.</p><p>The Smallpox Hospital moved to North Brothers Island in the 1950s, and Roosevelt Island became increasingly populated. It's been entirely abandoned ever since and only became a protected site by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1976. Its derelict facade remains standing to this day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyirsCnm6imlZl6qbvSqaCtmZyofHU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
