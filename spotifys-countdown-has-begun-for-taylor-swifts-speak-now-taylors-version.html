It’s almost like that feeling that we all long for, where you could re-read your favorite book again as if you’d never read it before to bottle that hopeful and anticipatory feeling. Swift’s re-releases of her albums embody that on a beautiful level.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Taylor Nation took to Twitter to announce that <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a></strong> has a special countdown and pre-save option for those of us counting down to the release like we do Christmas (and Halloween) morning.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our superwoman’s album is out SO SOON and the countdown on <a href=#>@Spotify</a> has begun! 🦸‍♀️💜 Go pre-save <a href=#>#SpeakNowTaylorsVersion</a>… we’ll be around. <a href=#>https://t.co/Vl5aevlKUK</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/A0eeMXuaC1</a></p>— Taylor Nation (@taylornation13) <a href=#>June 29, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Each album with a “Taylor’s Version” so far has been nothing short of magical, and as Speak Now is easily one of the best pieces of time in the music industry as a whole, we’re more excited about this one than we have been anything in a long time. If you use Spotify on mobile when you click the link above, you’ll see a particular Swift-tastic version of Taylor’s artist page with the option to pre-save Speak Now and a countdown that shows we’re merely days away from what is quite plainly, music to our ears.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SpeakNow.jpg><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>You see, Swift isn’t just an icon for stage presence, trendy hits, and beautiful vocals; she’s a storyteller, bottling up her emotions, journey, and the magic she sees in life and turning it all into song. She does the same for the hard things, the heartache, and the devastation, but she frames it in a way that will both break your heart and give you the hope that the sunshine eventually comes out after every storm, even if those storms last for far too long.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) is set to be released on July 7, so get ready to sing/scream the lyrics of “Long Live” as tears roll down your cheeks; we know we will be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TAsbvTop2yq12YvLa6052msKZdna60ecGenq6mXZu8s3nTmrClp6JiwLi1xa2qZqugmq6sec2ormaska65sL7SZq2eqqOevK97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
