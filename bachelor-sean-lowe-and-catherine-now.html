ABC's The Bachelor constantly purports to find true love, but there are usually more misses than hits. One of the rare exceptions was Season 17, which saw star Sean Lowe propose to contestant Catherine Giudice. Not only did the duo end up engaged, their wedding was turned into a live TV event a year later."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sean and Catherine are the ultimate outliers of that unfortunate trend. Nine years after tying the knot in front of an audience of fellow Bachelor participants at the Four Seasons Resort Biltmore in Santa Barbara, California, the duo remain married in 2023.</p><p>They've also started a family. The Lowes <a href=#>have three children</a>: sons Samuel and Isaiah (born in 2016 and 2018), and daughter Mia (born 2019).</p><p>Sean and Catherine have become a fixture of the Bachelor franchise. They guest-starred in the first season of spinoff <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> to give advice to the contestants and told the official Bachelor Nation YouTube channel how much the show affected their lives (outside of the obvious).</p><p>However, things haven't always been perfect. The duo appeared on WE's reality series Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars in 2015 to work through some issues — and it clearly helped since they're still together.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What have Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudice done since 'The Bachelor'?</h2><p>It's not uncommon to see Bachelor alums pop up on other television series, and Sean and Catherine have continued that trend. The duo have appeared on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? as well as Celebrity Family Feud and Celebrity Wife Swap. In the latter, they swapped lives with Jason and Molly Mesnick from The Bachelor Season 13.</p><p>Sean also competed on Dancing with the Stars in 2013, finishing sixth with partner Peta Murgatroyd.</p><p>Outside of television, the Lowes have their own stationery business called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LoweCo</a>. They brought the company to Season 3 of the CNBC reality series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billion Dollar Buyer</a>, in which they made a deal with series star Tillman Fertitta.</p><p>One thing this power couple's not so good at? Cooking. Sean was one of the celebs on Food Network's Worst Cooks in America in 2017! But other than that, they seem to have it made.</p><p>The Bachelor airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66ktMSlpqtlo5qur3nLqK6eZZGjsW6vwK2fnqqZo7Juus6w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
