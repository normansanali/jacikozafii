Perhaps taking a queue from the heroine of the 1995 cult classic, Michelle Obama chose a hunter green dress by Azzedine Alaia for President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday, Jan. 28.

"You don't understand, this is an Alaia," the Clueless character said about her outfit as she was being mugged in one scene. "It's, like, a totally important designer."</p><p>Perhaps taking a queue from the heroine of the 1995 cult classic, <strong><a href=#>Michelle Obama</a></strong> chose a hunter green dress by <strong>Azzedine Alaia </strong>for <strong><a href=#>President Obama</a></strong>'s State of the Union address Tuesday, Jan. 28. She also broke tradition by wearing a non-American designer for the annual political spectacle.</p><p>The First Lady, who just <a href=#>celebrated her 50th birthday</a>, dazzled from her skybox Tuesday evening as the President, 52, delivered his address. The health advocate stunned in the silk, knee-length, full-skirted dress paired with a belt and matching bolero jacket by Tunisian-born, Paris-based couturier Alaia.</p><p>And it's not the first time Obama has worn this particular garment; whe wore the same dress back in December 2012 when the and the President sat down with <strong><a href=#>Barbara Walters</a></strong> for a Nightline interview.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The First Lady's fashion artillery largely includes pieces by U.S.-based designers including her favorite, <strong>Jason Wu</strong>, and for previous years' SOTU addresses, she's traditionally worn outfits created by American-based designers like <strong>Narciso Rodriguez</strong> and <strong>Isaac Mizrahi</strong>. Her history with Alaia, however, stems from 2009 after she wore his design to a dinner in Germany.</p>&nbsp;<p>"She has a very strong presence and has set a new style for First Ladies," Alaia told <strong><a href=#>WWD</a></strong> back in 2009. "I'm sure women will follow her style — it’s simple and elegant."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6K2pLTEpaOeZZ%2BXrq6tjKyrmqyVYrynedOhnGatnp68r3nRnpqym5yasW6t2bOcnaGemnqiuMCimGacoprAtHnFoqmsrF2hrqXFjKymra1dZ31ygJFyaGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
