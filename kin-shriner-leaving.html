I knew [it was a] giant blunder, but NYC was the scene, so I jumped” at the chance to be a part of it.”</p><p>When one of Shriner’s followers suggested that NBC must have backed up the Brinks truck to his house to get him to leave Port Charles, he admitted that, basically, it had. “It was lucrative,” he replied, “but still a mistake.”</p><p>At the time, General Hospital fans feared that that was the end of Scotty. But of course Shriner returned — and left (appearing on the syndicated soap Rituals) and returned and left (appearing on The Bold and the Beautiful) and returned and left (appearing on As the World Turns) and returned and left (appearing on Young & Restless).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1256657986.jpg alt="Los Angeles, CA - 1981: (L-R) Shell Kepler, Sharon Wyatt, Bianca Ferguson, ackie Zeman, Kin Shriner appearing in the ABC tv series 'General Hospital', Luke and Laura's wedding.
