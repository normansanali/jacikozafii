The entrepreneur and former real estate mogul hasn’t been on the site for long, but his well-planned approach and reliable upload schedule keep new subscribers flooding in.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>Mann got his start in entrepreneurship quite early. His first few ventures saw the young professional pursuing numerous companies across fields, including an attempted cannabis-growing hydroponics retailer and a mortgage refinancing business. After numerous failed attempts, a lawsuit or two, and a short stint of probation, Mann turned his eye toward creating content on YouTube.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>He officially launched his channel, Dhar Mann, in 2018. Despite the short life-span his page has experienced, it has collected a surprisingly robust following. The page currently boasts more than 12.6 million subscribers, and a typical upload gets between 5,000 and 13,000 views. Some of the most popular boast more than 25,000. In total, the page’s numerous uploads have collected more than 5.4 billion views in the three years its been up and running.</p><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=513 data-injectable=true>Mann’s content is primarily composed of skits making fun of attention-grabbing controversies in pop culture. His uploads are persistently popular, which the creator has translated into monetary returns. His page averages around 300,000 monthly views, which Mann turns into a solid monthly income. Through the money he makes off of ads connected to his YouTube videos, Mann brings home around $1.2 million monthly. Annually, his income clocks in around $18.05 million, according to estimates from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Net Worth Spot</a>.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>These estimations fail to include any of Mann’s other money-making ventures, however, of which there are many. His former career in real estate likely still nets him at least a modest monthly income, as does his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">online store</a>, which sells everything from backpacks to hats, hoodies, and tees. This makes it likely that <strong>Mann</strong> actually brings in closer to Net Worth Spot’s higher estimate of $32.5 million a year.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Due to his impressive annual earnings, his overall net worth is quite high. Net Worth Spot estimates that the 37-year-old is worth a minimum of $72.21 million, but with all of his career ventures included, his actual net worth is likely over $100 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZrCgkal6qr%2BMnZ%2Baql2irq%2B60malnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
