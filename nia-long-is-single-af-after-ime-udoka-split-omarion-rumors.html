Dorsey</strong>&nbsp;— told&nbsp;<i>The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;</i>last month, shortly before confirming her breakup. “[Kez] still has moments where it’s not easy for him. … No one from the Celtics organization has even called to see if I’m OK, to see if my children are OK. It’s very disappointing.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “I literally <a href=#>felt like my heart had jumped out of my body</a>.
