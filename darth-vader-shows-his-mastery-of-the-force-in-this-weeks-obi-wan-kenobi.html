In the original trilogy he’s the embodiment of the Emperor’s will, with nobody able to match him in battle. Every other appearance has depicted him as someone you flee from rather than fight, perhaps best exemplified by him cleaning house in that unforgettable scene during the Rogue One finale. Well, this week’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a></strong> once again showed Vader at the height of his powers, demonstrating his terrifying mastery of the dark side of the Force.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=44 data-current-count=44 data-injectable=false><strong>Spoilers for Obi-Wan Kenobi episode 5 follow</strong></p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>The episode was essentially an extended riff on the Hoth sequence in The Empire Strikes Back, with our heroes trapped in an underground base as the Empire tries to take them out. After Reva had captured Obi-Wan, Vader touched down and began tearing through the base.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>In one of the most awesome live-action uses of the Force seen to date, Vader walked into a room to see the escape ship taking off and, with a flick of his wrist, immobilized it in midair. With its engines straining, he calmly dragged it to the ground and tore chunks out of it with the Force.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FUk28eeVIAABbJQ.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Fortunately, this proved to be a decoy, and Vader was left fuming that he’d missed his chance to capture Obi-Wan – though he soon got to work out any frustrations. Sensing an opportunity for revenge, Reva attempted to attack him from behind. In retrospect, she may wish she’d been a bit stealthier as Vader proceeded to absolutely demolish her.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>In this fight he proved he doesn’t even necessarily need a lightsaber, effortlessly deflecting her attacks with the Force alone. Reva never stood a chance, underlining that Vader cannot be defeated in a duel but – as hinted by Obi-Wan throughout the episode – there are other ways to achieve victory.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>Presumably we’ll see what that is in next week’s season finale, but in the meantime, this was a beautiful showcase of why Darth Vader is so feared.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Oaqa2gXauupbHRZqqhp6eoeqm10makmqukmr%2B6ec6fZK2glWKzsL7CnmSipl2ptaq%2FjLCcnqOjYryjtYywmKdlm5q7sK7IaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
