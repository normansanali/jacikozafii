While she does take ‚Äúfull responsibility‚Äù for the pose, she now regrets it and realizes that it could no longer be taken back.</p><p>‚ÄúOkay, can anybody tell me what I was thinking when I decided to pose like this on an international, worldwide poster that will remain forevermore? I remember doing this pose and thinking, ‚ÄòI think I look pretty cool here.‚Äô (laughs) So I take full responsibility for this choice, but oh my God, what am I leaning against?

The actress considered ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù on the aforementioned pose during press tours and the red-carpet premiere, just to see if she can make it a thing. She ended her video by saying that the awkward pose will return on an undisclosed date.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Despite what Gillan thinks, almost everyone in that poster looks awkward if you think about it. We have Star Lord wearing casual clothing. Meanwhile, everyone else is looking somewhere on the horizon. They‚Äôre a pretty awkward bunch, but Gillan is the only cast member who‚Äôs open about it.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=727 data-injectable=false>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is said to be the final film for this superhero lineup, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Bautista leaving the role of Drax</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speculation that this may be the end of the line for our heroes</a>.
