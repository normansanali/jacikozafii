Source: Getty ImagesDolly Parton is arguably one of the most popular country music artists around, but if there's one thing fans could agree on about the music star, it's that she's very private about her personal life.Â 
That said, whether or not Dolly has kids always comes into question, especially because no one knows anything about her mysterious husband, Carl Dean."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The singer has been married to her husband, Carl Dean, since 1966, but the couple never had any children together.&nbsp;</p><p>But even though we often hear about Carl but never actually see him, Dolly has been open in the past about her decision not to welcome children with her husband of 53 years.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Just a little #tbt for your feed ðŸ˜˜</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Dolly Parton</a> (@dollyparton) on Oct 24, 2019 at 9:57am PDT</p></figure><p><br>"It just wasnâ€™t meant for me to have children," Dolly candidly told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> in a 2018 interview. "When my husband and I first met, we assumed we would have kids, and I even had names picked out, but it never did happen..."</p><p>She added: "But we always had a lot of family around â€“ a lot of my younger siblings came to live with my husband and me in Nashville and some of them went to school there. They loved being with me, and I loved having them.&nbsp;And now I have the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Imagination Library</a> (her non-profit book-gifting organization for children) and have worked with so many kids."</p><p>The blonde beauty additionally opened up about how she has no regrets about choosing not to become a mom. "So my husband and I donâ€™t regret it â€“ we think about it sometimes and say, â€˜Lord, if we had some kids and grandkids now, theyâ€™d be driving us crazy!â€™ So this way, we just get to be each otherâ€™s kids," she said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In another interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour UK</a> in 2014, she talked even more about not regretting her decision to have kids. "My husband and I, when we first got married, we thought about if we had kids, â€˜What would they look like? Would they be tall because heâ€™s tall? Or would they be little squats like me?â€™ If weâ€™d had a girl, she was gonna be called Carla. Anyway, we talked about it, and we dreamed it, but it wasnâ€™t meant to be. Now that weâ€™re older? Weâ€™re glad," Dolly admitted.&nbsp;</p><p>But that doesn't mean she doesn't think about what things would be like if she chose to have kids. "I would have been a great mother, I think," she shared. "I would probably have given up everything else. Because I wouldâ€™ve felt guilty about that, if Iâ€™d have left them. Everything would have changed. I probably wouldnâ€™t have been a star."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Instead of having children of her own, Dolly has spent her career being the busy, bubbly, and happy person that she is. But we'd have to agree with her when she says she would have been a great mother, too!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ydpqWkqWK9or7TqKVmoJGrsm63yJ2q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
