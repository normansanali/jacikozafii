The original anime’s premiere was filled to the brim with bloody action, enticing all those who enjoy a good tale of revenge. From the director that brought us <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jujutsu Kaisen‘s first season</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jujutsu Kaisen 0</a>, Park Sunghoo, this new series has everything that it takes to become a hit. It follows Joe Higan, a ninja who deserted his clan to live in hiding — until tragedy struck, of course.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>After the murders of his wife and son, the protagonist dives back into his old life, intent on getting revenge by taking down that very same clan. Although simple, this premise is effective in luring us into Ninja Kamui‘s dark world, but it’s the episodes’ animation, storytelling, and tone that keep us hooked.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>After a bloody premiere, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode 2</a> turned its focus to worldbuilding, giving us an idea of the role ninjas played in society in the past, how that changed, and taking us on a trip as Joe searches for leads. While it was a nice change of pace from episode 1, there’s no doubt that the anime won’t keep it up for too long. No matter how many moments of levity we get, they’re always just a breath away from violence.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Besides, with Joe now in contact with FBI agents Mike Moriss and Emma Samanda, he’s one step closer to getting his much-desired revenge. We’ll have to wait and see how this attempt at exchanging information will turn out down the line, though.</p><h2 id=h-when-does-episode-3-of-ninja-kamui-come-out data-injectable=false>When does episode 3 of Ninja Kamui come out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ninja-Kamui-1.jpg><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Grab some popcorn and get comfortable, because according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adult Swim’s broadcast schedule</a>, episode 3 of Ninja Kamui is set to release on Saturday, Feb. 24 at 5am ET.
