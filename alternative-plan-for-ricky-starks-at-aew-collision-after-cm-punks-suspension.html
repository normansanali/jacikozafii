During that episode, after a loss to CM Punk, Starks attacked Steamboat, whom he believed had cost him the match by disrupting his pinfall attempt. This prompted Starks to unleash a barrage of belt lashes on Steamboat, venting his frustration.</p><p>In a unique turn of events, Starks has been active on AEW Collision in a managerial capacity, claiming to possess a manager’s license to oversee other talents. This managerial role saw him accompany Big Bill to the ring for a match against Vary Morales in the previous week’s episode. Furthermore, Starks verbally targeted Steamboat in a post-match promo, vowing to bring a “bigger strap” to the following week’s show.</p><p>Initially, Starks was anticipated to wrestle CM Punk at the All Out pay-per-view, potentially in the main event, given Punk’s Chicago roots. However, plans shifted due to Punk’s alleged altercation with Jack Perry at All In, which led to both wrestlers’ suspensions. Starks’ 28-day storyline suspension was seemingly coordinated, as he was scheduled to be reinstated on September 3, coinciding with the date of All Out.</p><p><a href=#>While Punk’s suspension and status for All Out remain unconfirmed by AEW</a>, Starks’ imminent appearance on Collision adds an intriguing layer to the evolving narrative.</p><p>Also confirmed for Saturday’s AEW Collision includes the Outcasts vs. Britt Baker, Hikaru Shida & Kris Statlander, Dax Harwood vs. Jay White, and the AEW Trios Titles match featuring The Acclaimed against Daddy Magic, Cool Hand Ang, & Daniel Garcia.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>As the anticipation builds, fans are eager to witness the twists and turns that AEW Collision will deliver this week.</p><p>Do you think this is a good alternative for Ricky Starks while CM Punk is out on suspension?
