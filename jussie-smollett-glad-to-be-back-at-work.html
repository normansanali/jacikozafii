They never waivered, they never straddled the fence, and for that I am forever grateful. I don’t take that lightly for a moment.</p><p>“My family, my friends, the true ones, if I never get to hug you in person, know that there’s a hug in my heart that I genuinely mean.”</p><p>Jussie spent just six days in jail before being released on bond and he recently revealed he starved himself throughout in order to gain “clarity”.</p><p>He said: “I was there for six and a half days. I fasted for six and a half days. I was fasting because that’s what we do in my family. Like we fast for clarity… I have never in my life, at least in my adult life, been as clear of mind as I was for those six and a half days… I was fasting until I found out whether or not I was gonna be in there for those five and a half months. I just wanted to know what my life was about to look like.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOo6ysq5maerS5zqWjnqykYrStrcNmq6hlkpp6o63CpGSarF2svLO3jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
