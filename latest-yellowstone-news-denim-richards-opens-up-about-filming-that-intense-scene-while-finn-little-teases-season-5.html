It was regarding the intense scene where Colby and Teeter are attacked while enjoying an afternoon together.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>Anthony asked what it was like to film that scene while sharing that it was a powerful one that resonated with fans. The care and concern everyone at the ranch had for Colby and Teeter shows just how much of a family the ranch hands have become and how cared for they are by the Duttons.</p><p>“We have this really exciting time with Jen Landon, who plays teeter. You know, we have this crazy scene in this creek where Wade and his partner are coming to essentially attack us, and so you know that scene was definitely not a one-taker. There’s a lot of moving parts in that scene. You know, it’s a creek which felt more like a river — it is pretty big. But, you know, and there’s horses, and the whole kind of thing is, you know, we get attacked, so we, you know, we’re in the water. There’s horses that are coming. They’re kind of whipping us kicking us, and then these horses are having to stomp on us, right, why we’re in the water underwater, trying to come up for air. And so they’re just based on the geography of the kind of coordination you can’t do that in one shot. So we had to kind of break that up, which, to most people, they’re like, Oh, that’s a relief, and it’s like it is, but you have to remember that it’s take after take after take on going into the water and coming out of the water. It’s very, very cold, but it was so much fun.”</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>Fun might not be the word you think of when you hear that they had to film an attack scene over and over, but Richards lives for being able to translate his physicality into acting.&nbsp;</p><p>“You know, for me as an artist, I live for things like that. I’m a very physical person. I grew up as an athlete. So for me, that kind of physicality of acting is something that allows me to like really get my teeth into it. The water was so cold, and now I mean, it wasn’t as bad as during the day — or when we’re talking about that scene specifically, the next day, or the next episode when I’m coming out of the water, and it’s night — that was like that was just absurd. It was so cold. But again, it was one of those moments, you know; we have the best stunt doubles. Stephen Kay directed us on that, and like I remember the craziest thing I’ve ever seen a director do. So we’re getting ready to get in the water, and I take my shirt off, and Jen has to take her clothes off, essentially, and get in the water, and Stephen and I can’t remember who the AD was at the time, takes his shirt off as well. And I was like, ‘Guys, what are you doing?’ and he was like, ‘I would never ask you guys to do something, you know that that you know, I wouldn’t be willing to do myself.’ I was like, dang, like that’s what’s up, and so that was really cool. Just speaking to your thing about like the family and that kind of extends not just in the world of&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;with the actors, but it really branches outside. Like, everybody that you see in every shot that you like, there’s a crew that are in there, mucking it together that are fighting the elements together, and we’re just the ones that happened to get most of the praise for it, but there’s a lot of moving pieces that go on behind the camera to make sure that you know there can be that level of intimacy.”</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>The level of intimacy isn’t just romantic between himself and Teeter; it’s with the entire cast and crew, as Richards describes. One of the things that draws people into the series is the level of the relationships being built and the depth in which they care about one another. The believability is as strong as it is because of the bonds formed off-camera.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Football or Yellowstone, that is the question</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ll probably have to stream the Vikings game while I’m on set filming for Yellowstone this evening!😈🤠 <a href=#>#skol</a> <a href=#>#YellowstoneTV</a> <a href=#>#DuttonRanch</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xg6S8r4f0d</a></p>— Jeremy Richardson (@Jeremy_Rich12) <a href=#>September 19, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Football season has returned, and everyone knows that life slows down when your team is playing a big game. That project that you need to start, it can wait. Cooking turns to take out, and responsibilities get pushed to the side so you can get in on the action.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Jeremy Richardson is part of&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;in season five. While he acknowledges that he can’t say much about it, other than he’s on the series as an extra cowboy, he’s still very excited about the opportunity — and rightfully so.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Today, he shared a tweet that sports fans can totally relate to. He’s got filming to do on the series tonight, and&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;is one of the only things that comes before football for this Vikings fan.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Just because he will be on set doesn’t mean he will miss the big game. Richardson says he’ll stream it between takes at work. If you’re a Vikings fan yourself, you’ll be able to catch Richardson riding horses and working on the farm and find him totally relatable next season!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Finn Little teases season five</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Finn Little (@finn_little_official)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>Finn Little is a welcome addition to&nbsp;Yellowstone&nbsp;for several reasons. Playing the role of Carter, “the kid” Beth brought to the ranch, he’s feisty and troubled but also realizes how lucky he is for his big second chance. He met Beth when they were both at the hospital visiting their respective fathers as they clung to life. Thankfully, John Dutton survived, but Carter’s dad didn’t — leaving him alone in the world.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>It’s been a wild ride since he joined the Dutton clan, but he’s figuring out how things work at the ranch and why it’s so important to ensure he’s working his hardest. He knows he’s lucky to be part of it all, and that’s a feeling that Little relates to.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>Sharing behind-the-scenes snaps and pictures from the set, Little feels lucky to be part of the Yellowstone family. His latest image shared the clapperboard for a recent episode of Yellowstone’s exhilarating 5th season.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>His caption says it won’t be long now, and the countdown for the fifth season is officially on. We’re less than two months away from the two-hour premiere, and with the promise of it being shocking, we’re taking all the time we can to prepare mentally.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytrdOeqq1lqZq5rbvWrKuoppViu6bD0mabnqaZonqztcKhmKuco2K8sbHNrGSuqF2Wr7DB02adoqSdnruoedOhmK1lmaPBprrSnmSsm5Wjsm7Dx6KjnmWWnruvecuiq62klWLBpq3Snqpmq5WWwLC6jG5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
