Court documents meticulously trace her whereabouts, hanging out with a boy in a Gap-branded hoodie – later identified as Pryor – around 6 pm. Not long after, surveillance cameras snapped her in an alcove near the crime scene, flanked by two boys who quickly bolted from the area just 10 minutes later.</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>Five days after the murder, Shane Pryor found himself in cuffs after attempting to elude the police by providing a fake name. Investigators stated Pryor admitted to soliciting sex from Harris but shifted blame to an unknown guy clad in black, aged around 14 or 15, who allegedly fired the fatal shot. Despite his protests of innocence, Pryor faces <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">charges</a> of murder, conspiracy, and firearms offenses, with the judge opting for adult court over juvenile proceedings.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=50 data-injectable=false>Philadelphia District <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Attorney Larry Krasner</a> said:</p><p>“We believe that he is criminally responsible for a homicide. We believe that he should be held accountable for that,”</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>Counter to accusations, Pryor and his close ones resolutely proclaim his innocence. Attorney Paul DiMaio said that the unfair treatment and resulting despair pushed him to escape. Last week, speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News Philadelphia</a>, Pryor’s mother pleaded for her son to turn himself in, saying his fear of turning 18 and facing transfer to an adult prison compelled his flight:</p><p>“He’s a kid. He’s been in there since he was 14, he still has a 14-year-old mentality, even though he’s 17. He’s just terrified.”</p><h2 id=h-the-end-of-the-line data-injectable=false>The end of the line</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Pryor captured by marshals on Sunday</figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Pryor’s extended escape came to an abrupt halt shortly after authorities <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">captured</a> his alleged accomplice, 18-year-old Michael Diggs. Accused of being Pryor’s escape chauffeur, Diggs faces charges including hindering apprehension and criminal conspiracy. The chase led marshals to Pryor, found on a SEPTA bus at 3rd Street and Roosevelt Boulevard on Sunday. Surrendering without resistance, Pryor was swiftly taken into custody, as revealed by the U.S. Marshals Service.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>In a post-capture conversation with Pryor, his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lawyer DiMaio</a> sensed the weariness and frustration fueled by the looming 18th birthday.
