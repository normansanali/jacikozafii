Ahead of his performance, Maluma donned a roomy pastel-pink blazer and matching shorts, complete with oversized pearl button accents. The singer paired the suit with coordinating jewelry, including pearl-laced bracelets, layered necklaces, metallic accented Travis Scott x Nike Air Force 1s, and jet-black square-framed sunglasses.</p><img alt="maluma latin billboards pyer moss suit" title="maluma latin billboards pyer moss suit" width=1537 height=2305 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-3298-3-jpg-1603380687.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Phraa</span></p><img alt="maluma pyer moss suit" title="maluma pyer moss suit" width=1537 height=2305 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-3300-3-jpg-1603380761.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Phraa</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For the Latin Billboards, the kids from my foundation and my family inspired me to get into the creative, visionary, and fashion design mindset for my look," Maluma tells BAZAAR.com. "I accepted an honorary award for my work with my foundation, so I thought it was right to design my own look. I wanted to have a color that represents purity and happiness with details that represent my brand with the pearl button accents with letters. I love pearls as they represent integrity and loyalty. I am loyal to working hard to help kids develop and accomplish their dreams in the arts."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For my carpet look, I wanted to go with Rat Pack meets Generation Z. I love the Frank Sinatra suit era, and I had the high-shoulder blazer but added the long shorts with Nike Travis Scotts to keep it young and fresh. The pearl accessories were perfect to bring in a modern-day elegance through a new generation in fashion," added Maluma.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During his performance, Maluma wore a breezy all-white dress shirt (thankfully for us, not completely buttoned all the way up!) with matching loose trousers embellished with crystal detailing which was made in collaboration with Kerby Jean-Raymond of the CDFA winning brand Pyer Moss. The performance outfit was inspired by legendary red-carpet looks worn by "My Prerogative" singer Bobby Brown circa the '90s, as seen in the sketch rendering below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Working on my performance look with Kerby Jean-Raymond was amazing. He presented a Bobby Brown '90s all-white silk look for the intimate piano concept, which had me excited as everything was in the silk materials and embroidery in the fabric with shiny stones to accent the mood lighting onstage. I love working with creatives like Jean-Raymond that bring music, culture, and influence together," continued the singer.</p><img alt="maluma pyer moss design" title="maluma pyer moss design" width=640 height=414 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/maluma-second-round-sketches-1603381354.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Pyer Moss</span></p><img alt="premios billboard de la mÚsica latina 2020 pictured maluma performs at the bbt center in sunrise, fl on october 21, 2020 photo by alexander tamargotelemundo" title="premios billboard de la mÚsica latina 2020 pictured maluma performs at the bbt center in sunrise, fl on october 21, 2020 photo by alexander tamargotelemundo" width=1000 height=648 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nup-191971-0096-jpg-1603381384.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Telemundo</span><p>Maluma onstage at the 2020 Latin Billboard Awards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maluma's stylist, Ugo Mozie II, echoed Maluma's statements on the effortless collaboration process between the singer and the Pyer Moss brand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When Maluma told me he wanted to be classy and make a statement, I knew my friend Kerby Jean-Raymond would be able to bring that vision to life," Mozie II tells BAZAAR. "Like Maluma, Kerby's brand, Pyer Moss, represents heritage, activism, and art. I knew the match would make magic. I wanted something timeless and achieved that."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
