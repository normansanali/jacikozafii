It’s the act of rubbing both legs together (as a cricket itself would when chirping) when you’re relaxing and lying down in bed,” says <strong>Mike Bohl, MD, MPH, ALM</strong>, a member of our Medical Expert Board and a certified personal trainer and nutrition coach. “It’s not strictly a medical term but is the term commonly used to describe the practice,” he adds. “Cricketing can be a conscious motion or not, and for some people, it may serve as a form of self-stimulation, or ‘stimming.'”<span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><p>Many individuals find the act of cricketing soothing and calming—especially when all snuggled up in a cozy, dark sleep environment. And as Dr. Bohl points out, you can do cricketing consciously or subconsciously. TikToker @notyouraveragethrpst posted a video asking others, “Who else is laying in bed just ‘cricketing’ their feet,” noting that she just learned about cricketing and never noticed she did it before she knew it was a thing. Other TikTokers joined in on the conversation, with one noting, “That’s the only way I’d go to sleep,” and another, “Other people do it too??” One user even commented, “As a kid, my mom used to tell me I should do this to help me relax and fall asleep.”</p><p class=c-article__related-link><span class=c-article__related-link-inner>RELATED: The “50-Mile Month” Walking Challenge Is a Surprisingly Easy Way To Get Fit</span></p><h2 id=how-does-cricketing-affect-your-body>How does cricketing affect your body?</h2><p>Stimming can have a positive impact on your body and feel soothing due to its predictable, repetitive nature. Rubbing your legs together continuously can distract you from other sorts of stimulation you might find more jarring, explains Dr. Bohl. “Stimming is sometimes more common in those with neurodivergent conditions,” he adds. “Other ways stimming can positively impact the body are through the benefits of physical touch (it can be relaxing to rub one part of the body against another) and from any associated hormones that may be released, such as oxytocin.”</p><p class=c-article__related-link><span class=c-article__related-link-inner>RELATED: The #1 Exercise for a Longer Life, Doctor & Longevity Expert Says</span></p><h2 id=are-there-any-downsides-to-cricketing-yourself-to-sleep>Are there any downsides to cricketing yourself to sleep?</h2><p>You’re in luck, because Dr. Bohl reveals there are no downsides associated with cricketing yourself to sleep. “That said, if you find the movement bothersome and can’t seem to control your urge to do it, you may have a different issue going on, such as restless leg syndrome,” he notes. “This sort of condition should be discussed with a healthcare professional.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png alt="Eat this, not that" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Sign up for our newsletter!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vWobBmm6KesKyx06KloGWppMKzecWenK1lk5a7brTEpadmqJWkva2xjJ%2BYpaRdlsCtscSpZJ%2BZo6mys3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
