To complete her look, she chose some dazzling accessories, just like a Mattel doll might have. A bedazzled silver chain belt hugged her waist, adding a touch of glamour, while her ears sparkled with silver star and heart earrings that dangled gracefully. And let’s not forget her footwear—a pair of fabulous pink Manolo Blahnik BB Pumps.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Margot has previously said that she originally didn’t believe the Barbie movie would ever get made because of the “unexpectedly deep” plot, which was enhanced by director <strong>Greta Gerwig</strong>. Margot told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fandango</a>, “Greta kinda pushes [the movie] in directions that I didn’t think [Mattel] would let us go in. I think a big part of that was kind of acknowledging the things that people find problematic about Barbie, as well as the things that people love about Barbie.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She added, “It’s a movie. It’s a movie that’s got so much in it. We’re in on the joke. This [movie] isn’t a Barbie puff piece.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, the actress has been busy perfecting the American accent for years and it appears her hard work is paying off once again for Barbie. However, spending so much time speaking with an American accent could mean forgetting certain Australian slang words. Margot had that exact experience when she forgot what the meaning of the word “Barbie” is in Australia during a recent interview.
