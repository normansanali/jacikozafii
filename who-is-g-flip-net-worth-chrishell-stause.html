After a seemingly whirlwind relationship, Chrishell and G Flip even flaunted a wedding after one year of dating, increasing the buzz around both personalities, but particularly G Flip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that this is G Flip's first high-profile celebrity relationship, plenty of people had never heard of them, and also worried over whether they are authentic in their love for Chrishell Stause. Here's what fans should know about G Flip and their career separate from Chrishell Stause.</p><h2 id=g-flip-broke-onto-the-music-scene-in-2018>G Flip Broke Onto The Music Scene In 2018</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-2023-06-01t221348-436.jpg><p>While fans only recently met G Flip thanks to Chrishell Stause, the musician has been on the radar since about 2018. The Australian musician, whose real name is Georgia Flipo, has tour dates lined up through 2023 and is already well-established on the music scene.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chrishell Stause's Richest Ex Is Worth An Absolutely Obscene Amount Of Money</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be fair, some of G Flip's newer music is about their relationship with Chrishell, but singing about love is nothing new. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">G Flip's author bio on Apple Music</a> calls out the singer's talent for guitar, bass, keyboard, and drums, and describes their musical trademark as "relatable songs about the ups and downs of young love."</p><p>Although G Flip made it "big" by 2018, they started out much earlier than that, in 2015 as a drummer and vocalist for a rock band. These days, G Flip focuses more on pop.</p><h2 id=g-flip-aka-georgia-flipo-is-worth-about-7-million>G Flip, AKA Georgia Flipo, Is Worth About $7 Million</h2><p>Thanks to their success in music, G Flip is worth about $7 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">depending on the source</a>. Some sources suggest G Flip is worth closer to $5 million. Either way, Flipo has plenty of cash to compare to their almost-wife Chrishell.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Selling Sunset Star Chrishelle Stause Wants To Adopt Kids</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Flipo has earned money through music sales, band affiliations, giving drum lessons, and selling concert tickets. In fact, while they were part of a rock band, Flipo had to offer drum lessons on the side to make an income before their music really took off.</p><p>After some time with the band, it came time for Flipo to go solo, which they have done quite successfully.</p><p><a href=#>Stause is worth around $5 million as well</a>, so while the two aren't massively rich, they're equals in the financial sphere. That fact alone might help alleviate fans' worries that G Flip may be looking for fame and fortune due to Chrishell's reality TV fame.</p><h2 id=chrishell-has-already-inspired-g-flip-39-s-music>Chrishell Has Already Inspired G Flip's Music</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-2023-06-01t220831-713.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans may already know that Chrishell and G Flip actually met because they worked together. While G Flip said the two were originally introduced at a mutual friend's party, they collaborated when Chrishell played G Flip's love interest in a music video.</p><p>Chrishell apparently nabbed the gig without knowing G Flip very well, but the video, which was released to YouTube on May 12, 2022, features the two in multiple scenes, most of which involve them making out.</p><p>That song wasn't necessarily inspired by Chrishell, but other music has been. In an interview ahead of Pride with Nylon, G Flip explained that one of their songs is specifically about Chrishell and the pair's experience falling in love.</p><p>The song, titled 'Be Your Man,' speaks to the couple's unique love story and the fact that Chrishell wasn't necessarily thinking she would fall in love with a nonbinary person after <a href=#>splitting from ex Justin Hartley</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Chrishell Stause Is The Busiest Realtor Out There, And It's Not Because She's Selling Houses</a></span></p><p>The song lyrics include references to Chrishell coming out; "Sorry it's the way you're hurting/What made you think that you deserve it?, Caught between what you think is right/And what you want, I understand /'Cause I get you emotionally, I'm not a man/But I can if you want me to be."</p><p>Flipo also remixed a song for Chrishell's birthday, but that one hasn't been released publicly; it's a cover of 'XO' by Beyoncé. In the interview, G Flip expressed that they probably wouldn't release it, but that it earned points for Chrishell's birthday, which would be hard to top.</p><p>Chrishell, for her part, is very supportive of G Flip's career and plans to tag along during G Flip's 2023 tours. While she still has Selling Sunset and countless other projects to prioritize, the couple is clearly serious about their relationship and each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=are-chrishell-and-g-flip-really-married>Are Chrishell And G Flip Really Married?</h3><p>Many publications reported the pair's wedding, but it later turned out the wedding wasn't legal, according to multiple sources. So while they are clearly dedicated to one another, the <a href=#>marriage isn't legally binding</a>—not that Chrishell cares.</p><p>TMZ reported that there is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no marriage license on file for Stause and Flipo</a> in Nevada, where their Las Vegas wedding took place, as of May 2023. That hasn't stopped many people from congratulating G Flip and Chrishell or kept the two from acting like newlyweds.</p><p>And while <a href=#>not everyone knew about the secret wedding</a>, both Chrishell and G Flip have the support of their friends and fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBus4yfo6KoXaOytXnWqKmtoF2YtbO10qGcpaRdqMGiwdKeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
