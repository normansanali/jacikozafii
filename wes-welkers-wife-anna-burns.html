She is the youngest of seven children. Unfortunately, this is all we currently know about her life growing up.</p><p>She essentially shot to fame when she won the 2005 Miss Hooters International Pageant in Miami, Florida. She then became Miss December in the 2005 Hooters calendar.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Seems like yesterday, <a href=#>#ThrowbackThursday</a>….the gorgeous Anna Burns-Welker <a href=#>#HootersCalendar2005</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yJMLKbTJkH</a></p><p>— Hooters Calendar (@HootersCalendar) <a href=#>October 18, 2013</a></p><p>In 2006, Anna Burns graced the cover of Hooters Magazine and calendar. The following year, she was also voted as Hooters’ 2007 Best Damn Dream Girl.</p><p>Anna Burns also made the headlines after she released a Facebook rant targeted towards Baltimore Ravens’ Ray Lewis after the Ravens defeated the New England Patriots in the 2013 AFC Championship Game — her husband, Wes Welker, was part of the Patriots squad at that time.</p><p>“Proud of my husband and the Pats. By the way, if anyone is bored, please go to Ray Lewis' Wikipedia page. 6 kids 4 wives. Acquitted for murder. Paid a family off. Yay. What a hall of fame player! A true role model!”&nbsp;<a href=#><u>Anna Burns</u></a>&nbsp;said in a since-deleted Facebook post.</p><p>She immediately issued a statement regarding her tirade against Ray Lewis:</p><p>“I'm deeply sorry for my recent post on Facebook,” she said. “I let the competitiveness of the game and the comments people were making about a team I dearly love get the best of me. My actions were emotional and irrational and I sincerely apologize to Ray Lewis and anyone affected by my comment after yesterday's game.”</p><p>“It is such an accomplishment for any team to make it to the NFL playoffs, and the momentary frustration I felt should not overshadow the accomplishments of both of these amazing teams.” she continued.</p><p>Let us now talk about how Wes Welker and Anna Burns’ love story came to fruition.</p><p>It is reported that Welker and Burns first met in 2010, but they mostly kept a low profile as there is no information regarding when they first started dating. The couple was spotted in the owner’s box of the New England Patriots where Welker played before.</p><p>They continued to keep a low profile until news — nay, rumors — of their engagement broke out in January of 2012. Even then, the public was still caught in a cloud of confusion.</p><p>On June 25, 2012, Anna Burns and Wes Welker got married in Aspen, Colorado.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Anna Burns Welker (@anabelwelker)</a></p><p>Tom Brady and his wife, <a href=#><u>Gisele Bündchen</u></a>, were in attendance for his wedding.
