His copacetic run from 2013 to 2017 already pulled off more than a lore in horse racing history. But in somewhat conditions, the fabled jockey couldn’t avoid the downturn of fate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 2020, Javier Castellano topped the list of jockeys to develop COVID-19. However, the story remained different from then until 2023 came into effect. The horse racing monarch opened up on things recently. The roller coaster journey couldn’t fall short of an adventure.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Javier Castellano reserves his best ovation for P. J. Campo&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>The horse racing sport imbibed itself unflinchingly in the lineage of Castellano. Javier Castellano’s father, Abel Castellano Sr. formed the first line of the horse-riding generation. For Javier, his in-laws’ connection also linked him to the game of the equines. Still, in the interview given to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>the New York Racing Association, Inc.</a>, the champion jockey named someone outrightly different to bring him in the path of glory once again. It was his agent, P.J. Campo. </span><i><span>“He has done a great job finding the best horses on the grounds, so I had the opportunity to compete and win those big races”</span></i><span>, the thankful Castellano confessed. He didn’t take the time to reveal further.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/061023-arcangelo-belmont-stakes-mc-0630p-105c4d.jpg><p><span>In the mentioned conversation, Castellano answered vehemently about his feelings after bagging the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. The 46-year-old jockey claimed, </span><i><span>“I am very blessed in my career, but especially in this year. To win the big races in the same year is always very special, but to win two of the Triple Crown races, and on two different horses, is really special.”</span></i><span> In the Kentucky Derby, Castellano rode on Mage to win the title. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>For the Grade 1 Belmont Stakes, the famed Arcengelo</a> paired with him in sharing the joy. That made the moment for his unsung grit as well.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>The grit effect in horse racing&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>From coming to the horse racing track from COVID-19 to earning 19 million USD this season witnessed a lot of windy moments in Javier Castellano’s life. </span><i><span>“I was devastated. I was ready to give up,” </span></i><span>was his reaction after tasting the dust in 2021. The Hall of Fame jockey started to gather might to call it a day in the sport. However, pairing with P. J. Campo in 2022 paid him jubilantly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Amateur Jockey Emphasizes ‘Special’ Relationship With Horse After Maiden Horse Racing Triumph</a></p><p><span>In 2022, the horse racing knight clinched 163 wins. Discussing the reason, Castellano said, <i>“Mentally, I had to be strong,”</i> to the Thoroughbred Daily News.&nbsp;Since then, the jockey didn’t look backward. This year, his country Venezuela, nominated him for the 2023 Athlete of the Year title. That will back his grit in the coming years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch this story: </strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Best Dressage Horse Whose Movements Could Even Compete With Ballerina’s Elegant Moves</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SsZKyon6fBtHnNnq6sZZikv7SxjKuYnKGenHqvsdasZJuklajAprCMoqVmpalisKK%2BxJ6pZqCfp8CmedGamqKml2K5prPEp5tmopGrtqa%2BjJyYrKyVobmius5mnqKulah6onnHnpirrJaaubV506ugm62kmnq1u4ysp56bmZa5brnEp6uoql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
