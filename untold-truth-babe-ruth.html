He was the kind of guy who would knock a ball into outer space and then jauntily round the bases like he owned the place.

He was charismatic, confident, and seemingly unconquerable.</p><p>Ruth's most dazzling display of dominance went down during the 1932 World Series, when the Sultan of Swat supposedly "called his shot." As The Chicago Tribune described, it happened during a Game 3 showdown between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs. Ruth was pitted against Cubs pitcher Charles Root. Hostility literally filled the air as contemptuous Cubs fans lobbed lemons and spat at Ruth. The battered batter reportedly pointed at the outfield repeatedly before hitting the "most stupendous home run in the history of baseball."</p><p>The epic homer essentially sealed the series' outcome and immortalized Ruth, who had apparently bent a baseball to his will. However, according to author and sportswriter Ed Sherman, appearances may have been deceiving. Pitcher Charles Root fervently denied that Ruth called his shot and called the story a lie for the rest of his life. There's video footage of the event (above), but it's ambiguous at best. Even if Ruth didn't actually call his shot, he definitely meant to maul that ball.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFlG5tcGelo8GwuMNmq6utpJ16o63BnmSrraSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
