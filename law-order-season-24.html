Court is adjourned on another season of Law & Order. But after three exits in Season 23 (and two more the seasons before it), fans can’t help but wonder what Law & Order Season 24 will look like and who else could leave or join the cast."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But after three exits in Season 23 (and two more the seasons before it), fans can’t help but wonder what <a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order</a> Season 24 will look like and who else could leave or join the cast.</p><h2>Who’s in the Law & Order Season 24 cast?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order</a> Season 24 cast will be down one member: <a href=# rel=noopener>Camryn Manheim, who announced her exit</a> as Lieutenant Kate Dixon a week before the Season 23 finale. “I had the most incredible experience being a part of the Law & Order Universe, and more importantly the Wolfpack. I’m so thankful for the three wonderful seasons that I spent with this wildly talented cast of merry pranksters,” Manheim captioned an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post at the time. “</p><p>She continued of her cast mates, “Mehcad Brooks, Reid Scott, Connie Shi, Anthony Anderson, Jeffrey Donovan, Hugh Dancy, Odelya Halevi, Tony Goldwyn and Sam Waterston. Not to mention the stellar guest stars that came in and out of the studio doors. I loved showing up for work each and every day, loved keeping the boys in line at Precinct 27 and most importantly, loved spending time with the most hard working, professional and kindhearted crew. They are truly New York’s finest. Something wonderful awaits me around the corner, and I can’t wait to see what it is. Until then… Go Knicks!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Kate-Dixon-Law-Order-2.jpg alt="Kate Dixon - Law & Order" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Manheim, who starred on Law & Order from Season 21 to 23, was the second cast member to leave the series in Season 23 following Sam Waterston, who played <a href=# rel=noopener>District Attorney Jack McCoy</a>. Waterston, who joined Law & Order in Season 5 and was one of the only cast members from the original run to return for the reboot, left in Season 23, Episode 5, “Last Dance,” in which McCoy resigns after he went against the mayor’s wishes to not question his son.</p><p>Waterston was replaced by Tony Goldwyn, who joined as District Attorney <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicholas Baxter</a> in Season 23, Episode 7, “Balance of Power.” Other than Manheim, no other Law & Order cast members have announced their exit, so it’s expected that the four remaining cast members — Hugh Dancy (Nolan Price); Odelya Halevi (Samantha Maroun); Mehcad Brooks (Jalen Shaw); Reid Scott (Vincent Riley); and Goldwyn — will return for Season 24. That also means that there’s at least one role open for Manheim’s replacement.</p><p>While no other cast members have announced their exits, we wouldn’t be surprised if more cast members also left after Season 23. Since the Law & Order reboot’s premiere with Season 21, four cast members have exited the series. In addition to Manheim and Waterston, Anthony Anderson, who played Kevin Bernard, also left in Season 21, and Jeffrey Donnovan, who played Frank Cosgrove, left ahead of Season 23’s premiere. Given the high turnaround at Law & Order, it’s possible that another exit could be in store.</p><p>As for who that will be, fans suspect that the next cast member to leave will be Hugh Dancy, who joined as EADA Nolan Price in Season 21. Fans suspect that Law & Order is setting the stage for Price’s exit based on his feelings toward new DA <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicholas Baxter</a>. Dancy could also be busy soon. News broke in May 2024 that a third Downton Abbey movie was in the works after 2022’s Downton Abbey: A New Era. Dancy previously starred as Jack arner in the 2022 film.</p><p>“I bet Hugh Dancy will be next to leave. Maybe not this year, but in the near future,” a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> user wrote. Another commented, “That’s my gut feeling too; they’ve been playing up Nolan’s dissatisfaction and resentment towards the new DA guy for the last couple of episodes already. It’s only a matter of time.” One more user wrote, “Hugh Dancy just strikes me as an actor that knows he can do better. The writing in this revival just isn’t very good.”</p><h2>What is Law & Order Season 24’s premiere date?</h2><p>NBC hasn’t announced Law & Order Season 24’s exact premiere date, at the time of writing. However, the network has confirmed that it will return in the fall of 2024 and keep it’s 8 to 9 p.m. time slot on Thursday nights. The series will be followed by Law & Order: SVU Season 26, which will air from 8 to 9 p.m. on Thursdays and followed by Found Season 2, which will air from 10 to 11 p.m.</p><p>The Law & Order franchise’s third current spinoff, Law & Order: Organized Crime, will also move to Peacock for its fifth season. (Its former time slot from 10 to 11 p.m. on Thursdays will now be taken by Found.) As for when Law & Order’s premiere date will be, we estimate that it will likely be September 26, 2024, based on the premiere dates of the recent past seasons, which have happened in late September.</p><h2>How many episodes is Law & Order Season 24?</h2><p>NBC hasn’t confirmed the episode count for Law & Order Season 24&nbsp;yet, at the time of writing, however, it’s expected that the series will return to its usual 22 to 23-episode count for Season 24. Like other primetime shows, Law & Order had a reduced amount of episodes — 13 — for Season 23 due to the Writer’s Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes that delayed production for Season 24 by several months.</p><p>Law & Order&nbsp;is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on the Law & Order franchise&nbsp;check out the <a href=# rel=noopener>craziest SVU episodes based on real-life cases in the gallery ahead</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmp52nqHytrdZmpquclad6tLHArKanZWJpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
