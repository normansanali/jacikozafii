The reality show chronicling their nuptials airs Thursday, January 26, 2023. It’s been a bit of a whirlwind romance for the couple, who met while filming DWTS in 2017, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>The pair took their relationship public after Nikki broke things off with her longtime boyfriend <a href=#>John Cena</a>. Having kids was a big pain point between the former celebrities, and ultimately the reason Nikki called off her engagement to the movie star, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>. The now-mom explained, “Even in the end when he was willing to give me kids, I could just tell it’s not what we wanted. And that’s really, like, you know, what pushed me in the end, was like, if I’m going to force someone to be a father.”</p><p>Luckily, Nikki found Artem, and they <a href=#>got engaged</a> in 2019, and he was happy to have children with her. In fact, he may even want more, although she is not so sure.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">For Nikki, having two kids seems like a big leap.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nikki Bella (@thenikkibella)</a></p></figure><p>Nikki and Artem found out they were expecting long before saying “I do.” In fact, the podcaster expressed shock at the news back in 2020, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> she thought she’d have a tough time getting pregnant and had planned to freeze her eggs. “Artem was immediately so happy — it was really cute,” the star confided in the outlet about finding out a baby was on the way. She added, “Scared, but I can’t believe this because it’s not like we were trying or, ‘Hey, we’re married, let’s have a baby.’ That wasn’t it at all.”</p><p>The other shock was that Nikki’s twin sister <a href=#>Brie Bella</a> was pregnant at the same time, with the stars <a href=#>being due</a> just a week and a half apart! Flash forward to July of 2020, and Nikki and Artem welcomed a <a href=#>son named</a> Matteo. By April 2021, fans were speculating that the new mom was expecting again, a rumor she shot down, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America.</a> She told her social media followers she was just "super bloated… from travel and hormones (milk is coming to an end.)"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nikki Bella (@thenikkibella)</a></p></figure><p>As far as having a second child, Nikki confessed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! Online</a> that she and her husband are torn. "Artem would love to have two kids and I would too, but the thought of being pregnant and doing all of that again and the baby stage — two changes your life." She cited Brie and her husband Daniel Bryan as being her example for the potential chaos, as the star is a mom to Birdie, age 5, and Buddy, age 2. "She's like, 'Oh yeah girl, it's different when you have two,'" Nikki shared.</p><p>Ultimately, Nikki is taking a second kid under consideration, but said, "I'm kind of like one and done. I'm happy with that, but we'll see."
