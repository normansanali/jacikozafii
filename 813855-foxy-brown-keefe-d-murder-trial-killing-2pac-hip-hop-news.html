Keefe D previously claimed in his memoir, Compton Street Legend, that Brown was present during a meeting with the late New York City socialite Eric “Zip” Martin, who he claims provided <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Orlando Anderson</a> with a gun. Anderson has long been suspected of pulling the trigger in the killing. Keefe D has since changed his tune about the story, claiming it all the be a lie.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“There are secret and delicate conversations going on about Foxy being a witness at the trial,” an insider said. “She could prove vital in taking the stand or even making a statement about her recollection of being around the men, who claim they were in her company for a short while before they set off to murder 2Pac. Obviously, central to her involvement to the trial will be whether she has any recollection of Keefe. The prosecutors know that having independent and credible verification of Keefe being in Vegas would be a major benefit to their case. And it would destroy Keefe’s defense of ‘there’s no evidence I was even there,’ which has been presented by his lawyer in recent weeks."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-keefe-d-appears-in-court-for-arraignment>Keefe D Appears In Court For Arraignment</h2></span><p>Duane "Keefe D" Davis, 60, walks out after a court appearance in Las.

"Being in this trial would bring a lot of eyes to her and not necessarily present her in the right light," they said. "Secondly, the characters she was socializing with back then had varied backgrounds and lifestyles. Another factor would be taking the stand means facing cross-examination, which could put her on record being asked about matters in her life which may be fresh or potentially shocking. Some people may forget that Foxy has a criminal past too, being convicted for assaulting two nail stylists in 2006. These interactions with Foxy are being kept secret between just a couple of the district attorneys and team members. Nothing is confirmed about what, if any, evidence she will provide.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keefe D's trial is set to commence on November 4. He has <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">maintained his innocence</a> throughout the proceedings.
