Even though she isn't a cast member on the MTV reality series anymore, she is still living a very public life. Farrah got a reputation for yelling at producers, fighting with cast mates, and speaking her mind. Farrah is still involved in many controversies today. It seems like every time she posts something on social media, people have something to say about it.</p><p>Now that <a href=#>Farrah's daughter Sophia is a teen</a>, the mother and daughter still seem to be close. However, the same thing can't be said of Farrah and her own mother, Debra Danielsen. Ever since <a href=#>Farrah's mom Debra was arrested</a> in 2010, the two have had a volatile connection. Several sources reported that the reality stars last talked in 2021. While people might hear from Farrah more than her mother, Debra is still a public figure. Here's what Debra Danielsen is doing now and what her rap <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> career looks like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-farrah-39-s-mom-debra-danielsen-do-after-their-fight>What Did Farrah's Mom Debra Danielsen Do After Their Fight?</h2><p><a href=#>Farrah Abraham fought with other Teen Mom stars</a>, but she has also argued with her mother Debra Danielsen on more than one occasion. It's impossible to look back on episodes of 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom without remembering the moments when Farrah screamed at her mom... often for no apparent reason. Debra seemed to be on camera as much as Farrah was. Whether taking care of Sophia or trying to repair her bond with Farrah, Debra had a memorable presence.</p><p>Now that Farrah is no longer a Teen Mom cast member, fans want to know what Debra has been doing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/debra-danielsen-farrah-abraham.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past few years, she has been exploring her love for rap. This seems to be something that means a lot to her. Of course, this announcement surprised many Teen Mom fans who had no idea that Debra wanted to be part of the music industry.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Farrah Abraham Vs.

She told Reality Tea, "To me, rap music is talking about what’s real, what’s affecting people. I love it, I take it seriously and I think it’s ‘bring people together’ music.”</p><p>According to Starcasm, Debra put out a song called "Debz OG" in 2017. The music video can be viewed on her YouTube Channel. It doesn't appear that Debra made any money from this song. It's unclear if Debra hoped to make a living from music. However, in 2021, she gave several interviews and said that she was recording an album. While people can find her singles on Spotify, it doesn't appear that she ever put out a full-length album.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/debra-danielsen-farrah-abraham-michael-abraham.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while her rap career didn't go anywhere, Debra is still showing her love for this type of music. She mostly seems to post on Instagram and TikTok, however. In April 2022, The Sun reported that she posted a video of herself rapping. She rapped the lyrics, "Chasing after capital like Texas. Flossin' - haters give me powers like I'm Austin.
