“It was a housewarming party that was filmed for the show,” an exclusive source shared with Us Weekly of the June 16 event, which featured numerous references to the couple’s “love bubble” — something Giudice, 50, has protected at all costs after she began dating Ruelas, 46, in July 2020."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Although the mood was “celebratory,” our source noted there was still a little “drama” that went down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Teresa-Giudice-Housewarming-0002.jpg><p>“<a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aydin</strong></a> was arguing loudly with someone, and <a href=#><strong>Jackie Goldschneider</strong></a> was also arguing with one or more of the new girls,” they shared of the event, which also featured some “delicious Italian food” from Calibria Pizza & Pasta and Giudice’s favorite tequila brand, Dano’s Tequila.</p><p>Giudice was excited to share the details of her housewarming party, as she posted numerous photos <a href=#>via her Instagram </a>which showed off decor from The Balloon Boss based out of Fairfield, NJ.

She has apologized to Teresa,” the rep shared with the outlet.</p><p>In addition to Singer, Giudice announced that she was “<a href=#>inviting a lot of Housewives</a>” to the event, making it a truly Bravo-friendly affair.</p><p>“We’ll see who comes and who can make it and who can’t make it,” the reality star <a href=#>exclusively revealed</a> to Us at the May 16 NBCUniversal upfront event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Teresa-Giudice-Housewarming-0003.jpg><p>The Standing Strong author, who <a href=#>got engaged</a> to Ruelas in October 2021, specifically noted she invited <a href=#>Real Housewives of Atlanta </a>star <a href=#><strong>Kenya Moore</strong></a>.
