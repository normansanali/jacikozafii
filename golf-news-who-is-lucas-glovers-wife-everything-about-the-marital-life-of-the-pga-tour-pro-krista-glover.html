Glover and Krista both welcomed their first child, Lucille, in 2013. In 2015, they welcomed Lucas Jr. into the family.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-golf-news-despite-etching-his-legacy-at-the-four-million-event-liv-golf-cameron-smith-reveals-the-staggering-sleepless-nights-before-joining-the-defector-league?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1025199482h.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Despite Etching His Legacy at the $4 Million Event, Cameron Smith Reveals the Staggering ‘Sleepless Nights’ Before Joining the Defector League</p></a><p><span>Krista Glover was born in Greenville, North Carolina. </span><span>She is Jay and Christina Wakefield’s child. </span><span>She is very active on social media. </span><span>Her Instagram account (@chicmeetsweststyle) has over 10,000 followers. </span><span>She is into fashion and design. </span><span>She also routinely gives beauty hacks as well. </span><span>Krista also endorses many brands online, like Givenchy and Dolce & Gabbana. </span><span>Her fashion sense is top-notch. She is one of the golf community’s most fashionable wives</span><span>. </span><span>One can spot her in high-class fashion societies and fashion weeks.</span></p><p><span><br>Not only Krista, but Glover is also very active on social media. </span><span>He never misses a chance to show his love and devotion to his beautiful wife on social media. </span><span>You can always see him bragging about her on Instagram.</span></p><p><span>Their relationship remained pretty much hidden from the prying eyes of the media. </span><span>However, one incident in 2018 could have strained their relationship.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Trouble in Glovers’ paradise, shocking details emerged</h2><p><span>A family violence allegation led to Krista’s detention in 2018 during the Players Championship. </span><span>Reportedly, there was an argument between Krista and Glover’s mother. </span><span>For this, Krista served a night in prison. </span><span>She was later released on $2,500 bail.</span></p><p><span>According to Golf Week, Krista agreed to complete 25 hours of community service after admitting to substance abuse. </span><span>Later, Glover made a statement on Twitter and referred to it as a ”private matter”.</span><span><span> </span>“On May 12, my wife and mother were involved in an argument to which the police were called. Everyone is fine. Regrettably, although Krista was charged, we are comfortable that the judicial system is able to address what actually happened and Krista will be cleared in this private matter. We thank you for respecting our privacy as we work through this unfortunate situation,” tweeted Glover.<br></span></p><p><span>There is always a tough ordeal that every marriage has to go through. </span><span>It depends on the parties involved how they handle it. </span><span>Some don’t pass through the storm, while others do and strengthen their relationships. </span><span>Fortunately, the Glovers belong to the second category.</span></p><p><span>Everything is fine now, and both of them have gone from strength to strength since then. </span><span>They also renewed their wedding vows. </span>“It was the closure of everything, of all the mess for us and a symbol of a new beginning,” Glover said. “It was emotional and symbolic.”</p><p><span>They have grown stronger each day thanks to Krista’s consistent support and Glover’s unshakable commitment to their relationship. </span><span>This is most apparent in their journeys. Due to their shared experiences, mutual understanding, and strong sense of camaraderie, Lucas and Krista have developed an unbreakable bond. We really anticipate seeing their lovely connection grow even more in the future.</span></p><p><strong>Watch this story-&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>“I Would Retire”: Moments After The Extraordinary Proposal by LIVGolf, Rory Mcilroy Leaves No Stone Unturned To Reveal His Seriously Hard Feelings</a></strong></p><p>What do you think about this beautiful couple?
