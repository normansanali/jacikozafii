He said in a later interview that the song would serve as the lead single for <a href=# rel>an upcoming album he has planned</a> for later this year. Now, he seems to be taking another step toward that project.</p><p>In a short Instagram clip posted today, the former <a href=# class=text-word rel>Migos</a> rapper teases the release of his next song and video. "FAN!!!! 9/15" the caption reads, confirming that the new track will be dropping later this week. In the short video, he also plays a brief clip of the song. With lyrics like "Tired of stressing bout what I can’t control," and a more somber instrumental it seems like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Offset</a> will be getting heartfelt and reflective on this one. Check out the full tease below.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Offset Thought Migos Should Be Higher On Billboard’s Rap Group Rankings</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-offset-s-new-song-is-on-the-way>Offset's New Song Is On The Way</h2></span><p>Recently, Offset has found a surprising ally in streamer Kai Cenat. When Kai was arrested for inciting a riot in New York over an ill-planned giveaway he held, the rapper came to his defense. Later the pair got on a stream together where Kai asked for some <a href=# rel>help to shoot his shot with SZA</a>. Even though they both liked the approach they came up with, ultimately it didn't work and he ended up getting blocked by the R&B darling.</p><p>One thing that has pervaded much of Offset's recent promotional material is references to Michael Jackson. That has come in a few different ways, <a href=# rel>starting with his fashion</a>. Since at least Paris Fashion Week earlier this year he's popped up numerous times in fits that feel analogous to the King Of Pop. Even in the new song teaser a vinyl copy of the singer's famous Off The Wall album can be seen. What do you think of the short tease Offset shared of his new single?
