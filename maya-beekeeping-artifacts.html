Jobón were hollowed-out logs that housed bees and they were capped with limestone lids known as panuchos.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490951 alt="Maya Shell Bead" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/star-shaped-shell-bead.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490951 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia</span><span class=caption-body>A star-shaped shell bead found at the site.</span></p><p>These jobón lids measured between 20 and 25 centimeters and dated to the Maya Postclassic Period (950-1539 C.E.).</p><p>“Only one of the lids is in a good state of conservation,” Carlos Fidel Martínez said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>statement from INAH</a>, but “the other two [lids] have a high degree of erosion.”</p><p>In addition to the lids, researchers discovered ceramic, stone, and flint artifacts, including a red and orange cajete, or vase, as well as an axe, a hammer, and a star-shaped shell bead.</p><p>Overall, researchers have found 261 artifacts at the site and are in the process of analyzing each one.</p><h2>The Maya Cultivation Of Melipona Beecheii Bees</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490966 alt="Melipona Beecheii" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/melipona-beecheii.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490966 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Government of Mexico</span><span class=caption-body>The Melipona beecheii, the variety of bee that the Maya cultivated.</span></p><p>The cultivation of bees is a traditional practice in Maya culture. For centuries before <a href=# rel=noopener>Maya civilization as we know it all but disappeared</a>, they harvested honey. Even today, Indigenous Maya in the Yucatán continue to use jobón to cultivate honey from the Melipona beecheii species of bee.</p><p>The Melipona beecheii is the Maya’s “sacred bee.” The Maya used its honey for trade, medicine, ceremonies, and food.</p><p>Melipona honey is slightly sour and less viscous than other types of honey. Today, Melipona honey is consumed for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-490950 alt="Indigenous Beekeeper" width=696 height=532 data-sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mayan-beekeeper.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-490950 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Mark Viales</span><span class=caption-body>An Indigenous beekeeper extracts honey from a jobón, a hollow log.</span></p><p>According to archaeologist Raquel Liliana Hernández Estrada from INAH, the area where archaeologists discovered these artifacts was not inhabited by the elite class. Instead, Maya of the non-elite classes likely powered the cultivation of this important commodity.</p><p>“Most likely, we are in the presence of housing complexes from cities peripheral to ceremonial sites such as the Chacchoben Archaeological Zone and the Los Limones site,” Hernández stated.</p><p>Overall, researchers have remarked that this discovery may be Mexico’s greatest archaeological find in recent decades.</p><p>After reading about these Maya beekeeping tools, dive into the story of <a href=#>El Castillo</a>, the largest Maya pyramid. Then, read about the hallucinogenic <a href=#>mad honey</a> found in the mountains of Turkey and Nepal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyurdiaZJudlaCyprzIp55mmaKptqetwq2q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
