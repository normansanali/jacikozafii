At the time, a source told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>that there was a “romantic vibe” between the two.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Rob and Chyna&nbsp;</i>alums’ <a href=#>romance quickly heated up</a>, sparking engagement speculation one month later. However, things quickly took a turn after they briefly split. “They had a fight about how much time they had been spending together but they’ll be back,” a source previously revealed to<i>&nbsp;Us&nbsp;</i>in March 2016. “They could be back together whenever, it’s so dramatic.”</p><p class=p1>The “Doom” performer — real name Angela Renee White — and the California native <a href=#>eventually reconciled one month later</a> before announcing they were <a href=#>expecting their first child together</a> that May. Daughter <a href=#>Dream</a> was born in November 2016.</p><p class=p1>“Dream was Rob’s favorite name because it was always his dream to have a baby,”&nbsp;<a href=#>an insider close to Chyna told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>shortly after the birth</a>. “She is gorgeous and looks a lot like Rob!”</p><p class=p1>After <a href=#>continuing to date on and off</a> while raising Dream, the twosome eventually split for good in 2017. Since then, <a href=#>they’ve been focused on coparenting</a>. “The key is basically communication,” the&nbsp;<i>Real Blac Chyna</i>&nbsp;alum — who also shares son <a href=#>King Cairo</a> with rapper <a href=#><strong>Tyga</strong></a> — <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;in July 2019</a>. “It makes it a little bit easier if you can communicate with your child’s other parent. That’s the best and healthiest way.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “My children’s dads … help out because you have to have that time to yourself, just to even go to the spa and kind of reset. The days that they’re with their dads, then I go take my trips. Basically, I’m always home with [my kids].”</p><p class=p1>While the Washington, D.C. native and the Arthur George sock designer sought a paternity arrangement in October 2017 to raise Dream, they eventually<a href=#> reached a new agreement nearly three years later</a>. In December 2020, the twosome <a href=#>agreed to share physical custody of Dream</a> across an alternating weekly schedule.</p><p class=p1>The pair’s arrangements made headlines in March 2022 after <a href=#>Chyna alleged she didn’t receive child support from Kardashian or Tyga</a>. “Yesterday I had to give up 3 of my cars … my reasons … morals, beliefs, being a single mother, no support I’m a MAMA,” she tweeted at the time, claiming she is “single [with] no support [and] child support.”</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>’s son later refuted the allegations via an Instagram comment.</p><p class=p1>“[I] pay 37k a year for my daughter’s school,” Kardashian claimed, noting that Dream resides with him Tuesdays through Saturdays. “I handle every single medical expense. I pay for all her extracurricular activities. Why would I pay child support? Lol.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to relive Kardashian’s ups and downs with Chyna through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv7CujKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mmKecXZe5oq%2BMnJ%2ByppGoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIytoKadnJ67pnnWbXBqaWhsfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
