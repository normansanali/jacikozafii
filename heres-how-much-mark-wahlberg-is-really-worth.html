According to the <a href=#>Daily Beast</a>, "He dealt drugs, was addicted to cocaine by the time he was 13, and found himself constantly in trouble with the law." In 1986, when he was 15 years old, <a href=#>Wahlberg was reportedly charged with a felony</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;allegedly chasing black kids with his friends, calling them the n-word and threatening to kill them.&nbsp;</p><p>Just months before his 17th birthday in 1988,&nbsp;he allegedly attacked a Vietnamese shopkeeper&nbsp;and lobbed racial insults while trying to steal beer. He was charged with attempted murder for the latter crime. According to <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, Wahlberg pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to two years behind bars, though he only served 45 days. But his violent acts didn't stop there.&nbsp;In 1992, Wahlberg and a friend "viciously and repeatedly kicked" his neighbor and fractured his jaw, reported the Daily Beast. They settled that case without criminal charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Wahlberg's past affected his business opportunities later in life.&nbsp;In 2014, he filed a petition to be pardoned for his 1988 crime, which was hampering his ability to gain a concessionaire's license for Wahlburgers, the burger chain he owns with his brothers, per the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>. The actor later ditched the pardon request, though he stressed that "some good did come out of it" because he got to apologize to his victim.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Wahlburgers</a> opened for business and even cooked up a reality show, but that's just one of the deals feeding Wahlberg's bank account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2lmaIF6e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZ2Wv6x51pqfpZqVp7RutdJmqZ6ZnKHGbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
