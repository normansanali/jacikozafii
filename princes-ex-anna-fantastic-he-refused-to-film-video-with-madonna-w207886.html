Following <b>Madonna</b>’s polarizing tribute to Prince at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards on May 22, the late “Kiss” crooner’s ex-girlfriend <b>Anna Fantastic</b> is claiming that her former beau shut down the pop diva’s idea to shoot a music video for their 1989 collaboration, “Love Song.”</p><p>“You know, I was there when they recorded their duet together … and she really wanted to do a music video and he refused. I heard the phone conversation,” Fantastic (née Garcia), 42, told <a href=#>TMZ</a> in an interview published on Tuesday, May 24.</p><p>Asked if Prince wasn’t happy with the outcome of his time in the recording studio with Madonna, Fantastic claimed that it wasn’t the track that her past love was displeased with, but the idea of appearing in a video with the “Like a Virgin” singer.</p><p>“I think he liked the song, but he didn’t want to do the video. I even said, ‘You and Madonna in a video could be really cool,’” the British actress recalled. “And he said, ‘Me and Madonna in a video? No thanks.’”</p><p>According to Fantastic, the Material Girl designer attempted to use her divorce from <b>Sean Penn</b> as leverage for Prince to accept her plea.</p><p>“Well, she also said, ‘You know, I’m going through a lot right now with my divorce with Sean,’” the London native continued. “And he said, ‘What does your divorce with Sean have to do with me or this song?’ He said, ‘I’m not doing the video with you.’”</p><p>Fantastic, who had a romance with Prince for several years in the late ’80s and inspired several of his songs, including “Pink Cashmere,” also slammed Madonna’s BBMAs performance during her chat with TMZ.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“Well, I mean, I don’t want to sound like <b>Simon Cowell</b>, but [Madonna’s] had loads of iconic performances,” she said. “But last night unfortunately was not one of them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/madonna-billboard-prince-tribute-zoom-7bcc1896-f980-40ab-9f45-764b7c5d9089.jpg><p>As previously reported, Madonna’s heartfelt tribute — a moving rendition of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U” and an onstage duet with Stevie Wonder of “Purple Rain” — did not sit will with many, including BET. The network shared a teaser of their own upcoming Prince tribute shortly after the show and tweeted: “Yeah, we saw that. Don’t worry. We Got You.”</p><p>Prior to the ceremony, some fans started an online petition at Change.org to try and stop Madonna from taking the stage, saying that Prince was “more than worthy of a better choice as a main performer.”</p><p>Despite the criticism, <a href=#>the Queen of Pop is keeping her head up</a>. “Deal with It!” she wrote on Instagram on May 23. “Anyone who wants to do a tribute to Prince is welcome to. Whatever your age Gender or skin Color. If you loved him and he inspired you then show it!!!! I love Prince 4 ever.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prince was found dead in his Paisley Park compound in Chanhassen, Minnesota, on Thursday, April 21, at 57. While his autopsy results have yet to be released, prescription painkillers were found at the scene of his death. Investigators are looking into whether a doctor was prescribing drugs to him prior to his passing, and are considering a possible overdose.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKa%2FjJ6vZpmeo65ussCnq5qrpJ6wbrTEZqmenqWosqV506hkn6Gconq3tcOepmavmam1brnAnaanppFixHN8lnFvb2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
