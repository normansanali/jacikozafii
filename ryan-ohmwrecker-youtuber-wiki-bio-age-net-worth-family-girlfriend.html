Then you have probably heard of Ohmwrecker. His real name is Ryan Lord, and he was born on 28 June 1983 under the zodiac sign of Cancer ,in Chicago, Illinois USA. He also goes by the names The Masked Gamer, TryhardGuy and Captain Von Sweatsalot, and is mostly known for his “Let’s Play” YouTube videos.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>First of all, you should know that he is one of the first gamers who started uploading their gaming videos on YouTube. He launched his own channel “OHMWRECKER” in 2006, and actually became a Verified Partner of YouTube in 2012.</p><p>We understand that it might be hard for someone to accept the fact that you can make yourself a career if, for example, you post gaming videos online, but as long as you can attract a big audience, then you can definitely do it. Ryan found his love in video games when he was still just a kid. There were some problems in his family, and he simply found comfort in games. The good side is that he is really good at these games, which gave him the opportunity to become a popular YouTuber. He plays two of the most famous games in the world – “League of Legends” and <a rel=nofollow href=#>“Fortnite”</a>, as well as &nbsp;“Battlefield”, “Bioshock”, “Command and Conquer”, “Dead by Daylight”, “Garry’s Mod” and “Rainbow Six: Siege”.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Going live right now on <a rel=nofollow href=#>@Caffeine</a>, doing a special stream playing Apex with Delirious and Toonz, come hang out! 😀<a rel=nofollow href=#>https://t.co/n3xkjJZmag</a> <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/EEcjSo0NTq</a></p><p>— Ohmwrecker (@Ohmwrecker) <a rel=nofollow href=#>February 7, 2019</a></p><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>So, we know only a little about Ryan – he had a really tough childhood, as his parents divorced when he was just a kid; he stated in one of his streams that his father is Polish while his mother is Italian. He left his home and quit school while he was in his teens, but never gave up and stayed strong which led to his decision to go back to school and matriculate in 2013. By this time he was also a popular YouTuber, and was already making a significant amount of money. In the beginning, nobody knew anything about him, he didn’t even want to say his name, but then he decided to share at least some info about himself – his name, date and place of birth and similar items. We do not know if he is married or if he is dating anyone – there are rumors but none confirmed.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>We are sorry to say this but we do not know what Ohmwrecker looks like. He is very good in hiding his identity and we can’t blame him. Besides, a bit of mystery is always good.</p><p>He earns most of his money from his <a rel=nofollow href=#>YouTube channel</a> – the more views you have on your videos, the more money you make from the ads watched. Ryan also sells his own stuff including hoodies, shirts and caps. Another thing – he is also a Twitch TV partner so he earns from that as well. Authoritative sources estimate that his net worth is over $1 million.</p><h2><span id=Ryans_friends>Ryan’s friends</span></h2><p>Because the four of them helped each other with their careers on YouTube, we should as well say a word or two about them. <a rel=nofollow href=#>H2O Delirious</a> (Jonathan, 31 years old) started his YouTube channel just a year after Ryan. According to authoritative sources, his net worth is estimated to be around $1.6 million as of early 2019. He currently has about 11.5 million subscribers to his YouTube channel.</p><p>VanossGaming (Evan Fong, 26 years old) has about 25 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, which makes him the owner of the 33rd most subscribed channel on YouTube. According to authoritative sources, his current net worth is estimated to be over $8 million. Cartoonz (Luke Patterson, 36 years old) has almost three million subscribers on his YouTube channel. According to authoritative sources, his net worth is estimated to be around $1 million.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><p>In 2017, he won the “Choice gamer” award. If you frequently watch YouTube videos, especially gaming channels, you might know some of the people who Ryan collaborated with – VanossGaming, H2O Delirious, MiniLadd, I AM WILDCAT, Bryce McQuaid, PewDiePie, TheRPGMinx, EatMyDiction and many, many more. Let’s just mention that <a rel=nofollow href=#>PewDiePie</a> currently has the most subscribed channel on YouTube with 86 million. When asked what kind of superhero he would be if he could choose, and what would his superpower be, Ryan said how he would be a superhero who makes people smile. He generally loves animals and had a dog named Buddy – he died on 2 September 2017.</p><p>He says that he has a rare condition called “Visual snow”, in which black and white dots start appearing in your vision. It might sound interesting, but it isn’t really, and it cannot be treated. Do you know the “League of Legends” game? Well, there is an item called “Ohmwrecker” and yes, you are right, it was named in honor of Ryan because he covered League of Legends on Voodoo Extreme and also helped with the beta testing. His YouTube account “Ohmwrecker / Maskedgamer” has a whopping two million subscribers. His <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram</a> account has more than 60 posts and almost 400,000 followers, but don’t hope to see how Ohmwrecker looks like because he doesn’t post pictures of himself. He also has a Twitter account with 24,000 tweets and over 650,000 followers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZlpuuqr7PqKqtZpOkunC%2B2JqlZqeYosSzscKknKtlqaTCtcHBnqlmr5mgtm6uyKhkmp%2BVYrumwIywpqusmGKzornIpbBmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
