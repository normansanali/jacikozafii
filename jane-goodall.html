Her height is 1.65 meters and her weight is 50 kilograms.</p><h2>Career</h2><p><strong>Jane Goodall</strong> has spent most of her life studying chimp behavior. She began studying the Kasakela chimp community in Gombe Stream National Park in 1960. She paid close attention to these chimps, naming them rather than assigning them numbers. After studying their personalities, she concluded that different personalities are not limited to humans. While observing their characteristics, she agreed with scientists who claimed that only humans are capable of making tools and that chimps are vegetarians.</p><p>Jane founded the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI) in 1977 to support Gombe’s research, and she is the global leader in charge of the primate conservation movement. In 1992, Jane Goodall established the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Center in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Jane founded Lake Tanganyika Catchment Reforestation and Education (TACARE) two years later with the main goal of protecting chimps’ habitat from deforestation.</p><p>The Jane Goodall Institute’s Center for Primate Studies was established at the University of Minnesota in the mid-1990s. Goodall’s archives were transferred from Minnesota to Duke University on March 11, 2011. Goodall is currently a member of Save the Chimps, the world’s largest sanctuary outside of Africa, in Fort Pierce, Florida. Jane is a vegetarian who supports the diet for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. Ethologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals was founded in 2000 by Goodall and Mark Bekoff.</p><h2>Achievements and Awards</h2><p><strong>Jane Goodall</strong> has accomplished a great deal in her efforts to protect and advocate for the safety of chimps and other animals. She was able to establish the Jane Goodall Institute to support the Gombe research in 1977. Her bold move to protect animals has earned her numerous honors, including Commander of the Order of the British Empire and a President’s Medal from the British Academy.</p><h2>Jane Goodall’s Net Worth in 2023</h2><p><strong>Jane Goodall’s</strong> main motivation for fighting all of these wars to gain animal rights was not money. Her net worth, on the other hand, is something to consider. As of November 2023, Jane Goodall’s net worth is estimated to be $12 million.</p><p>When properly cared for, animals are wonderful creatures. They are entitled to the same level of care that humans do. Jane Goodall demonstrated that there is more to animals than meets the eye.</p><h2>Jane Goodall Husband, Marriage</h2><p>On March 28, 1964, Goodall married photographer Hugo Van Lawick at Chelsea Old Church in London. However, despite their vows, their marriage did not last forever, and they divorced in 1974. Jane married Derek Bryceson the following year, who was a member of Tanzania’s parliament and the director of the country’s national park at the time.</p><p>Regrettably, he died in October 1980. Cancer was the cause of his death. Because of Bryceson’s position in parliament, Goodall’s research project (a tourism embargo in Gombe) was safeguarded.</p><p>Despite having studied primatology for over 50 years, Goodall says her best pet would be a dog and Bigfoot fascinates her. Jane suffers from prosopagnosia, a condition that causes her to fail to recognize familiar faces.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmqaVYrSwu8Oao6Vn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
