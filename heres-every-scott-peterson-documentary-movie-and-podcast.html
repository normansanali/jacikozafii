The case became such a phenomenon that it practically became an archetype in fiction, such as Gillan Flynn’s bestselling book, Gone Girl. Though Flynn asserted to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> that there wasn’t a direct correlation, it isn’t hard to see the connection between Nick and Amy Elliot Dunne in the book.</p><p>“I definitely didn’t want to do anything specific. One could point to Scott and [Laci] Peterson — they were certainly a good-looking couple. But they’re always good-looking couples. That’s why they end up on TV. You don’t normally see incredibly ugly people who’ve gone missing and it becomes a sensation. It could be any number of those types of cases, but that was what kind of interested me: the selection and the packaging of a tragedy.”</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>The case still inspires fascination, as indicated by every piece of media that has covered the mystery.</p><h2 id=h-every-documentary-movie-and-podcast-that-covers-scott-peterson data-injectable=false>Every documentary, movie, and podcast that covers Scott Peterson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-51842432.jpg><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>True to Flynn’s estimation, the Petersons were attention-grabbing because of how they appealed to audiences. They were an attractive couple in Modesto that should not have wanted for anything. But perhaps what created an influx of media coverage were the underlying concerns whether <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peterson will be released from prison</a>.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Documentaries covered these concerns years after the official verdict. While circumstantial evidence had piled up, it was shocking that the case featured no forensic evidence.
