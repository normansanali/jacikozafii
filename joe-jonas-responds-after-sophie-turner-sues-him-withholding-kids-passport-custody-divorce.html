In her case, Sophie makes a variety of shocking allegations, including that Joe is withholding their daughters’ passports, even though the family was apparently planning to move to the U.K., where Sophie is from.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">The Jonas Brothers Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><h2 id=sophie-claims-joe-is-keeping-their-two-kids-from-her>Sophie Claims Joe Is Keeping Their Two Kids From Her</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joe-jonas-gives-statement-to-fans-amid-divorce-but-refuses-to-address-allegations-against-sophie-turner.jpg><p>In accordance with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">legal records obtained by Entertainment Tonight</a>, Turner has formally requested the prompt reunification of their daughters, aged one and three. These documents specify that the couple established England as their permanent residence earlier this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furthermore, the legal paperwork discloses that the custody agreement, initially under discussion as part of their divorce proceedings, has now become a source of dispute.</p><p>The documents also allege that Turner found out about the divorce not from Jonas or his legal team – but from the media.</p><h2 id=joe-released-a-statement-denying-sophie-rsquo-s-lawsuit-accusations>Joe Released A Statement Denying Sophie’s Lawsuit Accusations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/joe-jonas-x-sophie-turner.jpg><p>Joe was quick to release a statement via his representative, denying many of the claims made in Sophie’s lawsuit. The singer denies blindsiding her with the divorce, rather claiming they had many discussions before he made his filing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“After multiple conversations with Sophie, Joe initiated divorce proceedings in Florida, as Florida is the appropriate jurisdiction for the case. Sophie was aware that Joe was going to file for divorce,” Joe’s rep explained. “The Florida Court has already entered an order that restricts both parents from relocating the children. Sophie was served with this order on September 6, 2023, more than two weeks ago," the statement reads.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was Sophie Turner Friends With Taylor Swift Before The Joe Jonas Divorce Scandal?</a></span></p><p>The statement moreover said that Joe is willing to co-parent Sophie, and she recently spent time with their daughters in New York (<a href=#>Sophie was also spotted hanging with Joe’s ex Taylor Swift</a> during her NYC trip).</p><p>“Joe and Sophie had a cordial meeting this past Sunday in New York, when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids,” the statement went on. “They have been with her since that meeting. Joe’s impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable co-parenting setup."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The statement further claims that it was only during the New York meet-up that Sophie asked for their daughters’ passports, so they could travel to England with her. The rep says that, had he complied, Joe would’ve been violating Florida law, where their divorce remains pending.</p><p>"Sophie advised that she wanted to take the children permanently to the UK,” it continued. “Thereafter, she demanded via this filing that Joe hand over the children’s passports so that she could take them out of the country immediately. If he complies, Joe will be in violation of the Florida Court order."</p><p>Joe’s team says he’s “okay with the kids being raised both in the U.S. and the UK," but that he and Sophie need to come to a co-parenting and custody agreement that’s in the best interest of the girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The statement went on to slam Sophie’s accusation that Joe is keeping the kids from her, saying, “This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending. When language like 'abduction' is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst. The children were not abducted.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dn7yvrdJmqZ6roKS7pb%2BMmp2tnaJiwLC8x6KcZqylp7umvoysrJ6rXZ22rnnWoquhoJ%2Bhsaq6xmaiopyjYr2iv9KppqusXZjCtMDOnbBmnJmrvLOvxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
