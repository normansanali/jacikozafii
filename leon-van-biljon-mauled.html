As majestic as they are, it’s important to remember that lions and other big cats are wild animals.

One of those lions went straight for Biljon’s neck. Staff members of the reserve quickly shot down a number of lions following the attack. However, when paramedics arrived at the scene, the 70-year-old was already dead.</p><p>“The decision to shoot the lions was made by people on the premises in order to get to the deceased,” Xander Loubser, a medical spokesperson told the press. “It is now a police matter, so the man’s remains have not yet been removed.”</p><p>All the lions that were shot and killed during the attack belonged to Biljon.</p><p>Cullinan Police spokeswoman Connie Moganedi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told</a> CNN that neighbors from the nearby lodges responded quickly to the attack and tried to help the old man.

An estimated 6,000 to 8,000 lions are bred and held captive in lion farms and sanctuaries in South Africa, where more than 200 facilities operate. While attacks in captivity like this might not always make the news, they do happen.</p><p>The majority of them, in fact, involve captive lions more than any other breed of Big Cats.</p><p>“About 60 percent of all the reported attacks on human due to predator interaction, involved captive-bred lions, rather than cheetahs or tigers,” Four Paws Director Fiona Miles said.</p><p>The grisly death of Biljon is a reminder that human beings working at these facilities are interacting with wild animals, not pets.</p><p>“These attacks can be avoided by not allowing any unnecessary human-wildlife interaction,” Miles pointed out after conveying her organization’s sympathies for Biljon’s family. “The fact remains that lions are wild animals and no matter how habituated or tame they might seem, they remain unpredictable and instinctive.”</p><p>Next up, read about how <a href=#>a pride of lions ate a group of poachers alive</a> in a South African game reserve.
