As she settled in, she got an unexpected visit from the 37-year-old Flip It Like Disick star.</p><p>“I wanted to be by the water,” the New York native explained when Kardashian caught him rummaging in the kitchen. “No one said they were going to be here today.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kourtney-Kardashian-Is-Surprised-by-How-Much-She-Enjoys-Alone-Time-With-Scott-Disick.jpg><p>Disick revealed that the pair’s sons — Mason, 11, and Reign, 6 — were staying with <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>. Their daughter, Penelope, 8, wanted to spend the night with <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>. “This is like the world bringing us together,” the Talentless founder teased.</p><p>Kourtney confessed to the cameras that she “can’t remember the last time” she spent time alone with her ex — and without their kids around — since they split in 2015. Before calling it quits, the duo dated on and off for nine years.</p><p>“It’s been years since we did this and it’s just a little bit weird,” she admitted as the exes binged on sweets during a movie night at home. “I forgot how nice it is to just have a conversation with Scott without the kids. We’re friends.”</p><p>Sitting beside Kourtney in a straight-to-camera interview, Disick asserted that things between them were “purely platonic.”</p><p>After splitting from the Kardashian Konfidential author, Disick moved on with <a href=#><strong>Sofia Richie</strong></a>. The duo were together for nearly three years before Us Weekly confirmed in May 2020 that they had pressed pause on their relationship. They briefly reunited before <a href=#>calling it quits for good</a> that August.</p><p>Disick’s <a href=#>close bond with his ex</a> was a point of tension between him and Richie, 22. “Sofia was getting mad that Scott was spending so much time with Kourtney,” a source revealed at the time.</p><p>As fans began to wonder whether Kourtney would get back together with Disick, a separate insider told Us in October 2020 that the twosome “will always <a href=#>have a playful relationship</a> with each other and love for each other,” but were only “focused on coparenting successfully.”</p><p>During a March episode of KUWTK, Disick revealed that <a href=#>Richie gave him “an ultimatum”</a> about his relationship with Kourtney. “I thought I would give it a try and make [Sofia] more a priority, but then even when doing that, I feel like she just started wanting to push Kourtney out,” he told <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and Khloé, 36. “I said, ‘The most important thing to me is my kids, and that’s my family.’ … [She] was like, ‘I don’t want to share you as a boyfriend with Kourtney.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Disick has since sparked a romance with <strong>Amelia Gray Hamlin</strong>, while Us confirmed in January that Kourtney is dating <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>. When it comes to their new relationships, the reality TV stars are <a href=#>nothing but supportive</a> of one another.</p><p>“[They have] an incredibly special bond that no one can ever come between,” a source noted in February. “[Their] history together and love for each other can’t be touched by anyone else, and they both know that.”</p><p>The final season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E! Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKoraKpu6bFjKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mqpynpKl6pbXSopqkZZiWw6Z5zKitop1do7aotNNmpqdlm6rEtbeO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
