Raike the lawyer, and ex-fiancée of Marian, was played by Thomas Cocquerel.</p><p>The reason the Australian actor won’t be coming back is that his character’s storyline reached its natural conclusion.</p><p>Raike had falsely identified as a member of high society and pursued a romantic interest in Marian Brook, a penniless orphan forced to live with her estranged aunts, Agnes van Rhijn and Ada Brook.</p><p>Aunt Agness could see past Tom Raike’s disguise and suspected he was an imposter. It led to her warning her niece that if they were to marry they’d be poor.</p><p>However, the young couple planned to elope.</p><p>In the season finale, Tom Raike stood Marian up as he changed his mind, hoping then to marry into money and leaving Marian heartbroken.</p><p>Tom Raike was not related to any other main character and as his secrets were revealed in season 1, season 2 holds no place for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-2022-04-18-at-15.18.50-1024x525.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=season-2-is-in-the-works>Season 2 is in the works</h2><p>Good news for Gilded Age fans, season 2 has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially confirmed</a> and is already in the works.</p><p>While the season is not expected to be released until 2023, Julian Fellowes revealed that they had thought about the premise in advance.</p><p>The official season 2 description, suggesting what fans can expect is as follows:</p><p>The Gilded Age was a period of immense economic change, of huge fortunes made and lost, and of fierce rivalry between old money and new. Nowhere is that rivalry more apparent than on East 61st Street, where Marian Brook and her thoroughly old money aunts, Agnes van Rhijn and Ada Brook, live opposite the stupendously rich George and Bertha Russell.</p><p>The Russells are both fiercely ambitious, he financially, she socially, and they are determined to reach the highest echelons of New York. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, Marian’s friend and confidant Peggy Scott forges her own path in the world of the Black elite.</p><p>In this glittering world on the brink of the modern age, will the established rules of society prevail, or will the game change entirely?</p><h3 class=tags-title>Related Topics</h3><p><h2>MORE TV STORIES</h2><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXTnGWcp51ksq95xptma2hiZ3xxgI5qb2ifmaGxprCMmp6eZaOarrS7zWZpZpuRqMFuwMeopJqrXZi8pL3UnqmepF2axarAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
