Still serving her signature “squint and pout” face, one thing about the Florida native has seemingly vanished now that filming has come to a close: Her signature headbands.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>Rocking a headband in each and every episode of The Traitors season 2, it turns out that Parvati was not trying to make a fashion statement. Instead, she was trying to come across as far more innocent, and far less deceiving, all in an attempt to avoid banishment.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>Although she was unsuccessful, the Survivor: Micronesia winner shared her strategy with Johnny Sibilly in an exclusive interview with Logo TV.

It didn’t work. Larsa [Pippen] was like, ‘You’re Snow White. Like, you’re trying to be so pure and innocent,’ and I was like ‘Okay, it’s not working,’ but like, the crazy thing is, I don’t wear headbands. Like, ever… I think it’s pretty obvious I don’t wear headbands, because I just like, plop them on my head.”</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>If the 41-year-old returns to reality television for another show — or another season of Survivor or The Traitors — will the headbands reappear?
