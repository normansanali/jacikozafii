She even made sure that her glam makeup matched her hair, as her bold lipstick was also a crimson red. To complete her sexy look, Megan paired the outfit with sky-high gold open-toe high heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/megan-fox-red-hair-time-100-gala-machine-gun-kelly-backgrid-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Megan looked gorgeous, per usual, MGK also looked as chic as ever. The “Emo Girl” rapper wore a transparent corset with leather sleeves and matching <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leather pants</a> to the lavish event on Tuesday night. His sheer bustier put his plethora of colorful tattoos on display while he puffed on a cigarette en route to the gala. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dad-of-one</a> completed his rockstar look with a pair of leather boots and styled his blonde locks in a sleek half-up-half-down topknot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The bombshell attended the event to support her fiancé who was also <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>being honored</a> at the event that night. While she was on the red carpet, Megan opened up to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Time&nbsp;</a>about ageism in Hollywood and how she has not dealt with that – yet. “I still look the way I look. And what I mean by that is, as long as you are still a commercial commodity, they don’t come after you,” she said. “So I haven’t experienced that side of Hollywood yet.” The&nbsp;Transformers&nbsp;star also told the outlet that being a sex symbol never bothered her. Megan noted that people “seem to not be able to value me for much more beyond” her appearance. “I never had a problem being a sex symbol. I never thought that that was a negative thing,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom-of-three</a> added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/megan-fox-red-hair-time-100-gala-machine-gun-kelly-backgrid-post2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Megan and MGK’s night on the town comes one week after the pop culture sensation <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clapped back</a> at a hater on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram selfie</a>. “Where your kids at?”, the follower commented, to which Megan did not hesitate to respond to. “wait wait wait. I…have kids?!? Oh my god I knew I forgot something!! Quick, someone call the valet at the Beverly Hills hotel. That’s the last place I remember seeing them. Maybe someone turned them into lost and found,” the 36-year-old wrote back. Many of her followers also backed her up and told the online hater to back off. “she can not [sic] post selfies because she has kids?? Wtf c’mon get a life please,” one of her fans chimed in.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The starlet and MGK <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> on Jan. 11 and are reportedly still planning their wedding, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>.&nbsp;Megan was previously married to actor&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brian Austin Green</strong></a>, 49, from 2010 until <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their divorce</a> in 2021.
