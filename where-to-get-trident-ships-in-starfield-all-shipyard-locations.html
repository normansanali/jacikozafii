Embark on your galactic adventure aboard the “Frontier,” a versatile starship that serves as your gateway to discovering diverse star systems and unlocking the mysteries of the cosmos. As you venture deeper into the game, enhancing your vessel becomes essential for success. This is where the shipyards come into play, serving as pivotal upgrade stations where players can augment their ships or procure superior ones, ensuring an enhanced journey through the stars.</span></p><h2>Shipyards and Ship Manufacturers</h2><p>Starfield boasts an array of shipyards, each administered by different companies and spread out across the star systems. Each shipyard carries a range of benefits and parts, some unique to certain places. The game houses 19 different ship manufacturers, each focusing on different aspects of a space vessel. These manufacturers include Amun Dunn, Ballistic Solutions Inc, Deimos, Deep Core, Dogstar, Horizon Defense, HopeTech, Light Scythe, Nautilus, Nova Galactic, Panoptes, Protectorate Systems, Reladyne, Sextant Shield Systems, Shinigami, Slayton Aerospace, Stroud Eklund, Taiyo Astroneering, and Xiang. They offer their services across various shipyards.</p><h2>Space Staryards</h2><p>Starfield also features six different Staryards that are in space. Players can find these Staryards orbiting planets or celestial bodies. Some of these Staryards include Deimos, Nova Galactic, Stroud-Eklund, Trident Luxury Lines, The Den, and The Key. Each Staryard carries its own individual selection of ships, ship parts, and missions.</p><p><span>Get updated – make sure you’re signed up for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarkari Result</a>!

It is situated in orbit around one of Mars’ moons and carries a unique stock of parts. Nova Galactic, conversely, is a relic of what it once was, now abandoned like Earth. Nevertheless, it still serves a purpose for specific ship parts. Stroud-Eklund is known for its luxurious ship range, albeit the parts can be pricey. Trident Luxury Lines might not have a lot of exclusive ship parts on offer but provides an array of transporting missions for players to gain credits. The Den, a charming location in the Wolf Star system, offers an excellent array of ships, parts, and missions. However, players should be wary of contraband and the Crimson Fleet. The Key, located in the heart of the Crimson Fleet territory, offers unique ship parts.</p><h2>Ground Level Shipyards</h2><p>Besides Staryards, there are also nine major ground level shipyards on certain planets. These shipyards provide everything players need upon landing on these planets. Some of these service buildings include Akila, Cydonia, HopeTech, Hopetown, Neon, New Atlantis, New Homestead, Paradiso, and Stroud-Eklund Showroom. Each of these shipyards offers an assortment of ship parts and missions.</p><h2>Characteristics of Different Shipyards</h2><p>Akila is home to the Freestar Rangers and offers some of the best space travel vessels. Cydonia, located on Mars, offers different options compared to Deimos. HopeTech, based on Polvo, provides the best shipbuilding parts across the organisation. Hopetown, also on Polvo, offers superior internal ship parts compared to HopeTech.</p><p>Neon is a bustling city featuring a shipyard that provides a variety of ships for players to pick from. New Atlantis, home to the UC Vanguard, offers robust ships and strong ship parts. New Homestead improves upon Nova Galactic and offers classic ship parts. Paradiso is a luxury resort also offering ship customisation. Stroud-Eklund Showroom, with its aesthetic appeal, offers luxurious ships and ship parts.</p><p><span>Starfield is a captivating space exploration game that offers an extensive array of shipyards and ship manufacturers, enriching players’ spacefaring experiences. These shipyards serve as essential hubs, empowering players to enhance gameplay by upgrading ship components or acquiring new, advanced vessels. With a diverse selection available, players can tailor their ships to align with their distinct playstyles, setting the stage for exciting and personalized adventures as they traverse the star systems.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK3RpJiroZWtrq56wqikaK%2BYmr%2BmedOoZKCdpGLBs7XDnqWtZaOdtrG%2FjKKlZquklr%2BntcSlm2aZnKF6tLTIqbCaqpRiubCvwK2gqKajZIFzhZdtaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
