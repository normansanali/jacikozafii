The son of actors Charlton Heston and Lydia Clarke, Fraser Clarke Heston was born in Los Angeles.Fraser Heston's filmography includes Alaska and the 1990 version of Treasure Island which cast his father as Long John Silver. As a baby, he made his film debut as the infant Moses (his father played the grown Moses) in the Cecil B. DeMille epic The Ten Commandments.While in the process of writing Wind River, a romantic adventure novel about 19th-century fur trappers, Fraser was convinced by producer Martin Shafer to turn the story into a film script. Discovering that film-writing came naturally for him, 22-year-old Fraser wrote his first screenplay, The Mountain Men, for Columbia Pictures, which became the feature film. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.7066666666667><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Fraser Clarke Heston</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 12, 1955</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 4" (1.93 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Director, Producer, Writer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Marilyn Heston</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Jack Heston</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Charlton Heston, Lydia Clarke</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Holly Ann Heston</td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0381699</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Movies</td><td>The Search for Michael Rockefeller, Alaska, Needful Things, The Crucifer of Blood, Treasure Island, Mother Lode</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=10.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Good work - by definition - is almost impossible to spot on its own.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>I think tastes change as you mature.
