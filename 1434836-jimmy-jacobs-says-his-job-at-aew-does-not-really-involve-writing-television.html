Speaking with Bryan Asbury on Developmentally Speaking, Jimmy Jacobs was asked to discuss what made him make the jump to AEW.
“It was time,” Jimmy Jacobs said. “My time at IMPACT, I had done what I was gonna do there, and it kind of hurt."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It hurt me to go. I knew my time there was over before I was going to AEW. I knew intuitively, like this is done. I’ve done what I can do. It’d been five and a half years. I felt creatively burnt out. They need new creative blood in the company to get it propelled. The dynamic with the guys on the creative team, it had become what it was gonna become, and I felt like this is the show we’re gonna do, and this is it.</p><p>“It can be better, I just don’t have the answers, and that’s what it felt like. I don’t have the answers to get IMPACT to where it can go. I’ve done what I can do for the company. At the very same time, Bryan Danielson called me about coming to AEW. Well, this is how it works. It’s like, I’m done here, and then the door’s gonna open here. Okay, let’s walk through it.”</p><h2 id=h-jimmy-jacobs-on-his-role-in-aew>Jimmy Jacobs On His Role In AEW</h2><p>Jacobs was then asked about his duties in AEW. He stated that his job does not really involve writing.</p><p>“Mostly what I do, I format the shows and I organize information and communicate information. It was never supposed to be a creative role,” Jacobs said. “Like I said, I was burnt out at IMPACT, I was burnt out writing wrestling television every week. I really didn’t want to do it anymore. So my job really doesn’t involve me writing wrestling television. It’s far more admin.”</p><p>Jacobs also noted that these responsibilities have been a nice “break”, and he was starting to feel his creative channel open again.</p><p>The full interview can be seen here:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsa3FrZmK3qrnMsmSjmZOkr7R50pqwrGWYnsButs6bZJqsXZayuHnDqJysZZ6kwW6%2BxJqjpbFdnru3u8uvnGavop7BqrrGZquepJWrtrS1zqc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
