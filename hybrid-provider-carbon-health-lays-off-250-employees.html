Bali wrote that the company’s core business grew four times last year, but Carbon had been drawing “significant” revenue from COVID-19-related services. As the pandemic shifts, Carbon is shutting down some of its COVID-specific business.
Additionally, Bali said Carbon had been focused on revenue growth, patient acquisition and retention, and service expansion over the past few years, and it planned to shift its target to becoming profitable."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

According to Digital Health Business and Technology, embattled digital mental health company Cerebral will also lay off workers this summer. Chronic-condition platform Thirty Madison let workers go last month in the wake of its merger with women’s health startup Nurx. Meanwhile, weight loss company&nbsp;Noom laid off about a quarter of its coaching staff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span id=docs-internal-guid-0a093ebf-7fff-8d19-fb43-1230a0992345>ON THE RECORD</span></strong></p><p><span id=docs-internal-guid-0a093ebf-7fff-8d19-fb43-1230a0992345>“These changes, alongside a number of non-personnel-related reductions in operating expenses, will allow Carbon Health to be profitable much earlier than we had originally planned, which is the prudent thing to do in today’s market.
