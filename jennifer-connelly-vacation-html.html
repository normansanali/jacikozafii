One of the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood, Connelly has seen successes year after year, the Academy Award-winning performer has continued to rake in castings and keep herself incredibly busy. Finally taking some time off and enjoying the incredible life that she’s built for herself, Jennifer Connelly recently took to Instagram to share a picture of a tropical vacation.</p><p>The image in question, which you can see at the bottom of this post, sees Jennifer Connelly posing up against a pillar in a yellow bikini with a table filled with food and wine in front of her while a glance at a tree or two in the background teases the warm location.</p><p>Casting a strong gaze at the camera, Connelly’s caption jests that she and the rest of the folks with her “take our vacations very seriously.” By the way the plates have mostly been emptied and the wine flowing, it looks like she and her crew are having a lovely break from the in and outs of everyday life.</p><p><strong>Jennifer Connelly poses up against a pillar in a yellow bikini with a table filled with food and wine</strong></p><p>Having such an early rise to fame has allowed Jennifer Connelly to be picky about what roles she’ll choose, with the last few years seeing her appear in titles including Only the Brave and Alita: Battle Angel.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-connelly-s-recent-work><strong>Jennifer Connelly’s Recent Work</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jennifer-connelly-tom-cruise-top-gun-maverick-900x506.jpg><p>Last year, she teamed up with Only the Brave director Joseph Kosinski to join the legacy of the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Top Gun" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Top Gun</a> franchise in the sequel film, Top Gun: Maverick. Blending both the old with the new, Connelly played <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>’s love interest in the second installment of the high-octane drama.</p><p>As for her most recent project, we’re still waiting to learn when Alice Englert’s (Ginger & Rosa) directorial debut, Bad Behaviour will land in cinemas following its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival back in January.</p><p>The black comedy stars Jennifer Connelly as Lucy, a former child actress who is searching for a deeper meaning to life through a spiritual leader named Elon Bello (Ben Whishaw). The film will also see Lucy struggling to get a good grasp on her relationship with her stunt performer daughter, Dylan (Alice Englert), and will also feature the talents of Dasha Nekrasova, Marlon Williams, and Ana Scotney.<br></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany</strong></h3><p>While he wasn’t pictured in her Instagram vacation shot, we can safely presume that Jennifer Connelly’s husband of 20 years and fellow actor, Paul Bettany, was there alongside the couple’s two children as well as Connelly’s son from her relationship with photographer David Dugan. A true story of Hollywood romance, Bettany and Connelly met on the set of A Beautiful Mind, the film that would see Connelly take home the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.</p><p>With both stars continuing to be two of the top earners in the industry, there’s no doubt that they were likely both enjoying some peace and quiet with those most near and dear on a gorgeous and relaxing beach vacation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnmpq7r7XFnqlmm5%2Bju6a4y7Jkr5mTlsGqu81nn62lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
