That being said, let’s take a look at some of the best WWE SmackDown matches of 2011:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Edge vs. Kane (Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship – January 7)</h2><p>Edge and Kane met multiple times inside the ring before their Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight title. The bout headlined the January 7, 2011, episode of WWE SmackDown.</p><p>The Devil’s Favorite Demon blasted the Ultimate Opportunist with a series of punches and kicks all over the arena, but was unable to keep him down. In the end, Edge retained his title following a skull-rattling Con-Chair-To.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Alberto Del Rio vs. Daniel Bryan (WWE SmackDown – October 12)</h2><p>Alberto Del Rio and Daniel Bryan were pushed to the main event scene in 2011. The pair collided against each other on multiple occasions between January and December 2011. One of their better matches took place on WWE SmackDown in October.</p><p>This was a technical masterclass from both men. Del Rio’s feud with Randy Orton was also tied into this match. The Viper showed up after Del Rio’s win to attack him, but couldn’t get the revenge he wanted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes (Street Fight – WWE SmackDown, November 4)</h2><p>Two former Legacy members collided as Randy Orton took on Cody Rhodes in a Street Fight. The latter was in the middle of his Undashing gimmick and displayed some solid character work during the match.</p><p>Orton, however, wouldn’t allow his former protégé to get the upper hand. The match saw Orton break Rhodes’ mask, setting him “free” in the process. In the end, the Viper put away the future American Nightmare with two RKOs for the win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Daniel Bryan vs. Mark Henry (World Heavyweight Championship Steel Cage Match – November 29)</h2><p>Daniel Bryan really stepped up his game in 2011. The American Dragon captured the WWE SmackDown Money in the Bank briefcase at the namesake event. He scored a win over then-World Champion Mark Henry for his title, but the victory was voided by GM Theodore Long due to the champion not being medically cleared to compete.</p><p>The two faced each other for the World Heavyweight Championship inside a steel cage on the November 29, 2011, episode of SmackDown. Bryan showed extreme confidence in the face of the World’s Strongest Man and even came close to winning the match on multiple occasions.</p><p>However, a miscalculation allowed Henry to deliver the World’s Strongest Slam from the second rope for the win. The American Dragon would eventually cash in his briefcase for the world title at WWE’s&nbsp;TLC: Tables, Ladders, and Chairs&nbsp;PPV in December 2011.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-randy-orton-vs-christian-world-heavyweight-championship-match-may-6>Randy Orton vs. Christian (World Heavyweight Championship Match – May 6)</h2><p>Christian captured the World Heavyweight Championship after an epic match against Alberto Del Rio at Extreme Rules 2011. Captain Charisma put his title on the line on the following episode of WWE SmackDown against Randy Orton.</p><p>This match was just a teaser of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">great feud</a> that followed between the two rivals. Both Orton and Christian displayed superb chemistry in this match. The Viper shocked everyone by winning the world title with an RKO out of nowhere.</p><p>: <a href=#>Best WWE SmackDown Matches Of 2012</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAkW1ob21dl7K0wIywrp5lo6KupLfDqK6nZZ2WwaS0xKxkqJ5dZ31yfQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
