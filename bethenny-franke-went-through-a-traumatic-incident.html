She said in her tweet:</p><p>“The hardest thing was my kid being afraid while I slept, but she’s learning to be safe and prepared in how to behave in a situation.” In addition, I have a platform to warn others to be careful and have a medical plan while traveling. Always have the contact information for one point person who answers at all times.”</p><h2>Bethenny Frankel is OK as she publishes vacation photos on social media.</h2><p>Though Bethenny Frankel’s allergic reaction tweet made followers nervous, she is still taking safety precautions when traveling. To prevent such difficult circumstances, the reality TV personality urges that travelers with allergies carry EpiPen Auto-Injectors. Fortunately, her subsequent Instagram updates contained photos of herself and her baby as they continued their journey, showing that Frankel is doing well. The photographs showed the mother and daughter having fun rafting, horseback riding, and mud packing.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bethenny-Franke-2.jpg alt="Bethenny Franke" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Another cute image showed Bryn and Bethenny Frankel snuggling in white bathrobes. The caption is as follows:</p><p>“It’s ride or dies for me… What we put into parenting multiplies tremendously. Time is so important because it is the only commodity with a finite supply. We can’t make any more money. We must utilize it carefully. There is no bigger gift I’ve been given, nothing I love more, and nothing I’m better at than you. Xo”</p><h2>The history of a TV personality’s allergy attacks is explored.</h2><p>This isn’t the first time Frankel made news about a unique seafood allergy response. She suffered a major attack in 2018 after eating fish in her soup and ended up in the intensive care unit. According to sources, she was with her now-fiancé Paul Bernon, who contacted 911 as soon as she became unconscious. The following year, she experienced a similar experience when she boarded an aircraft that served bass.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bethenny-Franke-3.jpg alt="Bethenny Franke" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bethenny Frankel is a well-known television personality who has hosted several programs.
