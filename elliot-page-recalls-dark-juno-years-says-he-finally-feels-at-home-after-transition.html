In a new interview, the actor—who came out as transgender in 2020—talked about finding peace in his new body and recalled the dark place he lived in for many years before he freed himself from society's expectations.
&#34;I can't overstate the biggest joy, which is really seeing yourself,&#34; Page told Esquire, speaking of what he's learned since his transition. &#34;I know I look different to others, but to me I'm just starting to look like myself."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's indescribable, because I'm just like, there I am. And thank God. Here I am. So the greatest joy is just being able to feel present, literally, just to be present. To go out in a group of new people and be able to engage in a way where I didn't feel this constant sensation to flee from my body, this never-ending sensation of anxiety and nervousness and wanting out," he added. "When I say I couldn't have ever imagined feeling that way, I mean that with every sense of me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Page—born Ellen Page—initially came out as gay in 2014 and said the reaction was much less cruel than when he revealed he was transitioning six years later. "Transphobia is just so, so, so extreme. The hatred and the cruelty is so much more incessant," he said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But in many ways, he got what he expected: "love and support from many people and hatred and cruelty and vitriol from so many others."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Page, who stars currently in the Netflix series The Umbrella Academy, also starred in the 2007 film Juno, where he, as Ellen Page, played a pregnant teen, with Michael Cera as her boyfriend.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Recalling that time in his life is bittersweet for Page. Though the movie pushed him into the Hollywood spotlight, he said it was also triggering for his mental health, as he had to play the part of a glamorous actress while internally feeling like a man.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I can't pinpoint a 'worst' day, but when Juno was blowing up—this sounds strange to people, and I get that people don't understand. Oh, fuck you, you're famous, and you have money, and you had to wear a dress, boo-hoo. I don't not understand that reaction. But that's mixed with: I wish people would understand that that shit literally did almost kill me," he said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Page said he struggled with eating disorders, intense depression, anxiety, severe panic attacks, and essentially "couldn't function." Often he would miss meetings or be unable to read or get through a script because his anxiety was so bad.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"So yeah, in my early to mid-twenties, I didn't know how to tell people how unwell I was. I would berate myself for it. I was living the life and my dreams were coming true, and all that was happening. And yet, for example, when I was shooting Inception, I could pretty much not leave whatever hotel I'd be staying in," he added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now that he has transitioned and is living the life he wants in the body he has always felt he belonged in, he said he wishes he would be cast in roles for cis males—like the rest of his male actor friends. "Of course I want a space where trans people are getting cast as cis characters. Of course," he said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since his transition, Page said he's received criticism, hatred, and even death threats, but he's also gotten reassurance and support from his loved ones, and, most importantly, he finally feels like he knows who he is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I could not picture myself as a woman aging," he told Esquire. "Obviously. It was just like, what is my future? There's not a future. That's kind of what it felt like. I would say, verbatim: I've never been a girl. I'll never be a woman."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
