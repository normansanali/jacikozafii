At one point, Kim told Kourtney she’s not the only one who gets frustrated easily by her, claiming that Kourtney’s friends often get together via text to vent about her.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_the-kardashian-jenner-family-net-worths-ranked-from-richest-to-poorest_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Kardashian-Jenner Family Net Worths Ranked From Richest To Poorest">The Kardashian-Jenner Family Net Worths Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>In the last decade, the Kardashian-Jenner family has built a vast empire.

"And we're on a group chat that's actually labeled 'Not Kourtney.'"</p><p>“[We] have to funnel what your friends are saying to us and have to figure why you're such a different person and why you have this vendetta out,” Kim explained of why they needed to create the group chat.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_a-look-at-kim-kardashian-s-net-worth-since-divorcing-kanye-west_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="A Look At Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Since Divorcing Kanye West">A Look At Kim Kardashian's Net Worth Since Divorcing Kanye West</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kim Kardashian knows how to leverage her fame, so it's no wonder her divorce has barely made a dent in her net worth.</p><p>When Kourtney pressed her sister to know why she’d participate in a group chat that’s so hurtful, Kim defended herself. "They're your friends, the ones that you speak to on a daily basis,” the SKIMS founder said. “But you take it all out on me. And I'm trying the best that I can."</p><p>This prompted Kourtney to call her younger sister selfish. "It's about you. You are a narcissist," she clapped back. "Anything you do, it's about you and about how it looks to the world about you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-believes-kourtney-isn-39-t-happy-in-life>Kim Believes Kourtney Isn't Happy In Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pregnant-kourtney-kardashian-slammed-for-insensitive-comments-amid-maui-wildfires.jpg><p>Kim went on to challenge her sister, asking her if she was happy in life, since those around her are beginning to question it. Kourtney is currently expecting a baby with her new husband Travis Barker. She already has three kids from her relationship with Scott Disick.</p><p>"We all are concerned,” Kim pressed. “We all think that you're just really not happy."</p><p>To this, Kourtney replied, "So, you're telling me that I'm unhappy and that I'm miserable and that you have a side chat called 'Not Kourtney,' but you're telling me that you're happy for me. I have a happy life and the happiness comes when I get the f--k away from you guys—specifically you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kourtney said it would make her feel better to see the group chat deleted, but Kim admitted she has chats like this for everyone she’s close to. "We have side chats about everybody. That's just what you do,” Kim said.</p><p>Kim and Kourtney have been feuding last year after Kim landed a partnership with Dolce & Gabana after they dressed Kourtney and Travis for their Italian wedding. Kourtney later accused <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim of turning her wedding into a networking</a> and business opportunity, and they’ve seemed to be on the out ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmKws7HArZysZZGjwap5yqisq6yemsZus9GorKllk52utXnFq6CeppSoeqex1J1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
