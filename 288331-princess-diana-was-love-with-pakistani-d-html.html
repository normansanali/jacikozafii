They officially separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Throughout their separation, she lived alone in Kensington Palace and had reordered life her way: enjoying the freedom that came with not being under scrutiny by the royals.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In 1995, during a visit to the Royal Brompton Hospital to see the husband of her soother in chief, Oonagh Toffolo, she met Khan.

Instead, the man slightly acknowledged with a quick nod and left the room. After admitting that he was handsome, Diana turned to her friend, calling out the surgeon's name as seen on his shoes.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Following the first meeting that blew her away, the people's princess tried to get Khan's attention, but he paid no attention. She consistently visited Joseph throughout his three-week stay and often popped in to chat with the surgeon.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Diana even tried to read Gray's Anatomy so she could have things to discuss with Khan.
