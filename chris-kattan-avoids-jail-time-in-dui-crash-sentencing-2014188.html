Though no one was injured in the accident, Kattan did fail a field sobriety test and was promptly booked into the Van Nuys jail. He was released a few hours later on a $15,000 bond.</p><p>At the time, the star sent out several tweets trying to quell the rumors about his arrest, which, in a nutshell, provided some excuses (like the fact that he'd just gotten off a 15 hour flight) and downplayed the situation (pointing out he was released without bail and still had his driver's license).</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since receiving his formal sentence, however, Kattan has not commented on the incident on social media.</p><p>Still, it's not quite over yet. Next month, a restitution hearing will be held to determine how much money Kattan owes the state for damage to the Caltrans truck he hit. (Our guess is it will wind up considerably north of his $500 fine.)</p><p>At least everyone involved, including Kattan, survived this unfortunate incident relatively unscathed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewG63wK2rmqZdlsOwtcOsZKOZmaF6tbXMnmSipl2Zwqp5wquYrKBdqLKvwMSnmqKml2J%2FcX2Tam9xZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
