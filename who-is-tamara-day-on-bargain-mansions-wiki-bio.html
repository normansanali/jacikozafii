Born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, Tamara often followed her father during his designing endeavors. Her father was actively involved in home renovations and would ask Tamara to help him out every time she missed curfew. What Tamara once considered punishment soon turned into interest and Tamara enjoyed accompanying her father.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>At first, Tamara never thought she would follow her father’s footsteps. But when she got married to Bill during the mid 2000s, things changed for the better. In 2008, the pair bought a 5,000 square foot home at a bargain price. The house needed working on and Tamara put her skills to use.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Personal Life</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tamara is currently in a <a href=#>long-term marriage</a> with Bill Day. The pair&nbsp;met in 1998, got married in November of 2000 and are currently celebrating 23 years of marriage. The pair are parents to four children(eldest son, Henry Day, second-oldest son Bobby Day,youngest son Tom Day and youngest daughter Nora Day), all of whom are actively involved in the business. Even though Bill works in finances, the pair did their first-ever house flipping project in 2008 which gave birth to Tamara’s amazing career.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Website-33.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Professional Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After renovating her home, Tamara became interested in renovating things. She made it her weekly routine to visit the garage and estate sales. Even though Tamara made a name for herself in home renovation, she was primarily interested in restoring old pieces of furniture.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Website-34.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This interest led Tamara to establish her first company,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Growing Days.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She used the first floor of her home as a display location and would invite people over during an open house weekend. A growing business brought more pressure on Tamara and added on her responsibilities as a mother. In light of this, she decided to take a break from her shop. Her loyal clients were left distraught and pleaded with Tamara to get back on the field. This led her to work as a consultant for small home renovation businesses.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bargain Mansions</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As Tamara’s popularity grew, she began to gather attention from several sources. One of the sources was the DIY network who wanted to make a TV show with Tamara as its lead. The show was later pitched to HGTV and Tamara starred in an all-new reality series which is currently airing its fourth season. The show follows Tamara and her crew as they purchase old homes and transform them into lavish mansions.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Website-35.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Her status as a reality star only brought Tamara more work. Unable to cope with the pressures of her family, TV series, and extra work, Tamara set up an online business front. This allowed her to perform most of the work without leaving Kansas.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rumors</h2><p>Tamara Day has faced some rumors and controversy. They are:</p><ul><li>Tamara Day is not a real designer. Some critics have questioned Tamara’s credentials and qualifications as a designer, claiming that she does not have any formal education or training in the field. They also accuse her of copying other designers’ styles and ideas.&nbsp;</li><li>Tamara Day is too rich to be relatable. Some viewers have complained that Tamara’s show is unrealistic and elitist, as she deals with multimillion-dollar mansions that are out of reach for most people. They also criticize her for spending too much money on unnecessary luxuries and details, such as expensive furniture, appliances, and accessories.</li></ul><p>These are just rumors and controversy that Tamara Day has faced. However, she has handled them with grace and professionalism, and she has continued to impress her fans with her amazing work on Bargain Mansions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Tamara used to buy old houses, renovate them and sell them before the reality show Bargain Mansions. After entering the Television Industry, she played a role in The Mailbox (2007) and DIY Ultimate retreat (2017). Her best work in hosting and managing so far can be seen on the show&nbsp;Bargain Mansions, on DIY’s Network. As per the source she earns around $10,000 per episode she features.&nbsp;Tamara Day’s net worth remains under review, which is hard to understand since most of her net worth results from her salary as a reality star. Judging from her popularity it would be unfair for Tamara if her net worth isn’t around $3 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Trait</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=10><tr><td>Height</td><td>About 167 cm or 5’6″</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>About 67 kg or 147 lbs</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Face</td><td>Oval-shaped with high cheekbones and a defined jawline</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Hair</td><td>Blonde, wavy, and shoulder-length</td></tr><tr><td>Eye</td><td>Bluish-Gray</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Eye shape</td><td>Almond-shaped with long eyelashes</td></tr><tr><td>Body type</td><td>Slim and fit</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Skin tone</td><td>Fair with a warm undertone</td></tr><tr><td>Tattoos</td><td>None visible</td></tr><tr><td>Piercing</td><td>Ears pierced</td></tr><tr><td>Birthmark</td><td>None visible</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Smile</td><td>Bright and cheerful with white teeth</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Dress style</td><td>Casual and chic with a mix of colors and patterns</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Accessories</td><td>Earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, and watches</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMCmmKuZXZmuunnOp2SbmaKcrqq6jKaYp6uZpLu0edaioqJlkp68cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
