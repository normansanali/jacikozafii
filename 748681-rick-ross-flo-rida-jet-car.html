Jet Car Official, come on baby. Give it to me, Jet Car Official. And if they want one of these, where can they get one from? Oh, you already know I’m gonna tag Jet Car Official.

We finna turn up. As soon as I get back from Dubai, it’s going down," Rick Ross continues. “So when y’all see me on the water, when you see the Luc Belaire race mobile, oh, it’s going down. It’s going down. Flo Rida, Freezy, much love. You already know.” The hitmaker's new jet car is far from his first luxury vehicle, however. Last month, he hopped on social media once again to unveil <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his impressive car collection</a>. He has so many, in fact, that he has to use his private jet hangar to store them all.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Flo Rida getting Rick Ross a custom pink and black "jet car" for Christmas this year? Do you think it was a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">generous gift</a>?
