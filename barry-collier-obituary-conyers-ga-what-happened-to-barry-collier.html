On August 29, 1931, Barry Collier was brought into the world by his parents, Helen Ettinger Collier and Samuel B. Collier. Collier was born in the city of Detroit, which is located in the state of Michigan. His mother and father were overjoyed to finally get their son. In the year 1956, Barry attended both the University of Michigan School of Dentistry and the University of Detroit in order to improve his education in the field of dentistry.</p><p>He did this as part of his initiative to further his education. During his time in the service, he served in a number of different areas across the world, including Savannah, Georgia, France, and Germany. He joined the United States Air Force in 1956 and participated in the military for a period of time. Those who are able to carry on his legacy include his wife Judy, his daughter Karen (Scott) Whetter, his granddaughters Ava and Gracie, his daughter Amy Collier, his son Steven (Jenny) Collier, his granddaughters Ashley, Lindsey, Paige, and Victoria, his sister Sandy Fox, his father-in-law Larry Gaige, and ten great-grandchildren.</p><p>His legacy will be carried on by these individuals. A number of people had previously passed away before to his passing, including his daughter Kerry Jean Boardman, her father, and his sister Linda Elias. He was the last of his family members to pass away. As a result of the fact that Barry and his family were able to enjoy a great deal of happiness and joy while they were in Duck Lake, he felt a great deal of pride for them. After becoming a skilled dentist for fifty years and devoting his entire life to his job, Barry made the decision to retire when he was eighty years old. He had dedicated his entire life to his profession.</p><p>In his practice, he displayed an extraordinary amount of enthusiasm.
