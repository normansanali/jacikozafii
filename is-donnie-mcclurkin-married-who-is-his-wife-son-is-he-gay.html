At the age of 8, he lost his younger brother to a hit-and-run, shortly time after, he was sexually abused as a child by his uncle and over the years his uncle’s son sexually abused him again.&nbsp;Donnie’s painful life experiences once again reignited as two of his sisters suffered from drug addiction.&nbsp;Nevertheless, there is always a light at the end of every dark tunnel and the light in the tunnel (life) of Donnie Mcclurkin was Jesus Christ whom he found while going to church and encouraged by his aunt who sang with Andraé Crouch, a gospel musician.</span></p><p><span>As a teenager he formed a musical group called the McClurkin Singers and after a while he put together another called the New York Restoration Choir which he started recording with in 1975. They were all in devotion to his new found love. in Jesus Christ and ultimately in pursuing his career as a gospel musician.</span></p><p><span>In 1989, the South Carolina gospel musician was hired as an associate minister at Marvin Winans’ Perfecting Church in Detroit, Michigan, where he served for more than a decade.</span></p><p><span>His respite from the vicissitudes of life was, however, cut short in 1991 when he started having sharp pain and swelling followed by internal bleeding which was later diagnosed as leukaemia.&nbsp;It was as if illness had come to cut short his joy and the blessing he had become in Christ for many believers his doctor suggested immediate treatment but for his faith in the word of God Donnie who had 31 year old then decided to practice the very thing that every Christian minister preaches;&nbsp;the omnipotence of God to heal everything.&nbsp;For this, his belief did not fail him.&nbsp;As he not only survived without undergoing medical treatment but went on to do other great things spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p><span>Over the years, Donnie Mcclurkin has built a successful career as a gospel musician with many awards to go.&nbsp;He has to his credit his 1996 self-titled album&nbsp;</span><span>Donnie McClurkin</span><span>&nbsp;on the Warner Alliance label,&nbsp;</span><span>Encore</span><span>&nbsp;in 2013 on Verity Records, and&nbsp;</span><span>Duos</span><span>&nbsp;in 2014 on RCA Inspirational.&nbsp;Some of his spirit-reviving singles are “Church Medley” (2006) and “I Need You” (2014).&nbsp;Donnie has won three Grammy Awards, two Soul Train Awards, ten Stellar Awards, two BET Awards, a Dove Award and an NAACP Image Awards with many more to come.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Donnie Mcclurkin married, who is his wife and son?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Around August 2016, the gospel musician whom God healed of leukemia was reportedly in a relationship with Nicole C. Mullen, a gospel singer when she made an appearance on TBN.&nbsp;</span><span>Praise the Lord</span><span>&nbsp;denominational talk show with fellow Pastor AR Bernard.</span></p><p><span>Matt Crouch, the host of the show, announced that Donnie was getting married, no one was to think about who would be the bride, as Nicole C. Mullen fit perfectly into the image of a better half for God’s servant.&nbsp;McClurkin didn’t deny the show’s likelihood, but Mullen clarified his stance on Twitter, stating that while they were dating, they’re not ready to get married.&nbsp;She shed more light on the topical issue in a video interview she had with Prime Minister Gospel, stating that they were heading towards this (marriage) but protocols had to be followed and they had to still talk about a lot of things.</span></p><p><span>This therefore means that Donnie Mcclurkin is not yet married to Nicole C. Mullen but is still in a relationship with her.</span></p><p><span>The musician has a biological son named Mathew McClurkin (born in the year 2000) whom he had with Kim, he is also the father of a daughter named Michelle whom he adopted at the age of 9, just the year following after the birth of her son.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is he gay?</span></strong></h2><p><span>After losing his brother in a hit-and-run accident, Donnie and his other siblings were sent to stay with their grandmother and after some time with their uncle Clarence.</span></p><p><span>It was his uncle who at the time who he described as a “broken man” robbed him of his sexual innocence.&nbsp;At age 8, before he had ever had his first kiss from a girl, Donnie was sordidly raped by his uncle and then thrown into a world of confusion.&nbsp;When he was 13, his uncle’s son Clarence Jr. also raped him and even made him his sex slave by threatening to do worse to him if he told anyone.</span></p><p><span>Donnie McClurkin lived in confusion for years; he even found like-minded men in the church that was his refuge.&nbsp;Nevertheless, with the redemptive love of God, he was able to find peace.&nbsp;His past experience at the hands of gay parents, however, did not make him gay.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiho2KxsLrNopxmpZOYuba%2ByqKlZqWRp7%2BqscNmrqGnXZ7AbrTIrGSwoZaaerS7zWagrGWYmnqordho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
