Kaitlyn Bristowe, who was the star of the eleventh season of The Bachelorette, recently announced that her own line of wines is now available, slightly ahead of schedule.
Though the alcoholic beverages won’t officially go on sale until later this month, the former Bachelor contestant simply couldn’t contain her excitement. “I could no longer wait … so my wine is now available for pre-launch on my website,” Bristowe, 33, wrote on Instagram."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You will receive it mid-June! So not TOO long of a wait.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kaitlyn-Bristowe-Wine-Line.jpg><p>The line, which is called Spade and Sparrows, currently consists of three wine varietals that have been “hand-selected” by the reality star. Each wine has both nights in and evenings out in mind, and they all cost around $20 per bottle, not including shipping.</p><p>The rosé has hints of rose petals as well as “added flavors of wild strawberries, apricots and white raspberries.” The pinot gris, on the other hand, boasts notes of citrus blossom, lime zest, white peach and honeydew, creating what is described as an “explosion of flavors.” Last but not least, the cabernet sauvignon is “bold and mysterious” thanks to a flavor profile that includes vanilla, cocoa dust, black cherries and sugar plum.</p><p>However, if any of those wines sound good to you, you’ll have to wait a bit longer before you can enjoy any of them. Though Bristowe announced the pre-launch just days ago, all three wines have already sold out. When one fan lamented on Twitter that she waited too long to order Bristowe’s creation, the Canada native said she would be “restocking soon.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“THIS IS WHY YOU NEED TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE NEWSLETTER,” she jokingly <a href=#>added</a>.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Bristowe’s wine line already has a handful of high-profile fans. When the “Off the Vine” podcast host teased the pre-launch on Instagram last month, several members of Bachelor Nation sent along their congratulations – Bachelor season 13 alum <strong>Molly Mesnick</strong> commented using the wine and praise hands emojis, while <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a> from season 14 of The Bachelorette wrote: “Yay! Stocking up now.”</p><p>Tell Us: Would you try Kaitlyn Bristowe’s wine line?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqSZmam5urqMm6miq6SkxKa%2FjLCgp51dobavsYyhmKxlkaG%2Fpq3DsmSsp5yZerDB02g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
