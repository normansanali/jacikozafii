&#34;I'm still trying to understand what happened,&#34; host Conan O'Brien said.
&#34;It's a fascinating story,&#34; Pill, 27, explained of the September 2012 incident, &#34;involving not knowing that my new BlackBerry had a touch screen and responding to somebody on Twitter like, 'Oh yeah, New York was great, it's 9:30 on a Wednesday, also, apropos of nothing, here are my boobs!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Newsroom actress relived the embarrassing moment in which she accidentally tweeted a photo of her breasts while visiting Conan on Tuesday, Sept. 3.</p><p>"I'm still trying to understand what happened," host <a href=#><strong>Conan O'Brien</strong></a> said.</p><p>"It's a fascinating story," Pill, 27, explained of the September 2012 incident, "involving not knowing that my new BlackBerry had a touch screen and responding to somebody on Twitter like, 'Oh yeah, New York was great, it's 9:30 on a Wednesday, also, apropos of nothing, here are my boobs!'"</p><p>Why did she have the photo in the first place? "I had one of these pictures on my phone because I had been away from my, at the time, fiance and we had spoken on the phone the night previous . . ." the actress explained, without going into further detail.</p><p>"It's a dumb thing to do, I suppose," Pill admitted of snapping the shot. "And now I realize just how dumb and so embarrassing, so hideously embarrassing that for about three months after it happened…anytime I met a new person I [kept thinking], 'Boobs! Nice to meet you, you've seen my boobs.'"</p><p>After Pill tweeted and quickly deleted the topless photo in September 2012, she wrote, "Yep. That picture happened. Ugh. My tech issues have now reached new heights, apparently. How a deletion turned into a tweet . . . Apologies."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the time, Pill was engaged to actor<strong> Jay Baruchel</strong>, who had a good laugh over the incident. "My fiancee is a hilarious dork," the This Is the End actor, 31, tweeted. "I'm just glad it didn't happen to me first. Smartphones will get ya. CC Alison Pill. Viva Ludditism."</p><p>Sadly, the Canadian stars <a href=#>called off their three-year engagement</a> in March 2013. A source told Us Weekly that the couple's long distance relationship got the best of them. "Working and living in Canada is something that [Baruchel] is very passionate about. He wanted her up there more often, but she really likes Newsroom and the opportunities that are there for her," the insider explained. "They were doing the long distance [thing] a lot."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJmovK95z6KjpWWkpL2tsdKsZK2vmanBpr6MqZ%2BorJ9irqSvyJ2cp6xdrK60ecOupJtlmJ6xprvUrKOyZZWir6K%2B0ZqqrKGenHpzfJBsa3Jn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
