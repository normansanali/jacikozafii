I’ve been experimenting with a lot of vegetarian and vegan food,” she explained.</p><p id=par-4_61>“I think the biggest thing I’ve learned with trying to cook healthier is that I don’t use lower-fat substitutes like skim milk, and I don’t skip butter or cream. For me, I enjoy the flavors, and I’d rather have a little bit of the good stuff and control the portions — that’s also why I don’t use sugar substitutes,” Yearwood revealed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Yearwood talks about her delicious Sweet Pea Burgers</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>Trisha Yearwood’s Slow cooker pulled pork barbecue is an indulgence that can be lightened up by serving with veggies as sides and no bun.</figure><p id=par-5_31>Trisha Yearwood shared that she continues to create healthier versions of her favorite flavors to allow her and Brooks to enjoy the tastes they love without the extra fat and calories.</p><p id=par-6_40>“For Garth and me, I make these delicious sweet potato burgers. Now, normally, I’m not too fond of many veggie burgers.

Sometimes I’ll eat a burger plain with no bun.
