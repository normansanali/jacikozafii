"Every time I sat down at a drum set, I would think of that."&nbsp;</p><p>Grohl's solution to the problem was to not&nbsp;sit down at a drum set. After contemplating his options, and even considering quitting music altogether, he remembered Stewart Copeland of The Police. Copeland, a fellow drummer, had a solo project called&nbsp;Klark Kent, which allowed him to make music as someone who was decidedly not "Stewart Copeland from The Police."&nbsp;Grohl chose a similar approach, and became the Foo Fighters, writing and playing all the songs for the project's self-titled debut album by himself. For live show purposes,&nbsp;he recruited bass player Nate Mendell and drummer William Goldsmith, as well as former Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear.&nbsp;</p><p>Grohl initially found the frontman role difficult, but the album came out in 1995 and was a success. Just like that, the&nbsp;Foo Fighters were an esteemed band.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline​ at​ 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkXBucXFfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dqbWmecWopmaemZy1tbHRrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
