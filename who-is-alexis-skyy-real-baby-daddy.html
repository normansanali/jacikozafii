Others think she did it for money, but the real baby’s daddy is a successful entrepreneur in his own right.

The biggest clue was that in December 2020, Brandon Medford commented on a picture of their daughter, Alaiyah Grace, “Daddy’s girl,” with a heart.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From then on, the rumors started swirling that Alaiyah is Brandon’s daughter. Not only that, but Fetty Wap claimed he was not the biological father to Alaiyah back in 2019. Although his Instagram post has since been deleted, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fetty Wap</u></a> reportedly said,&nbsp;</p>“I’mma [sic] always love Lai Lai. I was there when she was born. I was there for her doctor’s appointments. Me and her mother fell out but that ain’t got nothing to do with the baby. When I feel like I want to be there, I’m going to be there. But as far as me going above my boundaries – nah. If it was biological with me, then it would be different.”&nbsp;<p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Brandon Medford</u></a> is actually a really successful car dealer. He’s known for selling rare cars to high-profile celebrity clients and he has over 190k followers on Instagram, which would be way too high if he was just any old car dealer. He’s the founder and CEO of PTG365, and according to Alexis, he wouldn’t take a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>paternity test</u></a> unless she bought a car from him.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brandon Medford took a paternity test for Alexis Skyy, but Fetty Wap did not.</h2><p>In a recent episode of The Kitchen Talk Podcast, Brandon discussed his journey of finding out he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alexis Skyy’s real baby daddy</u></a>. He explained that the idea of taking the paternity test was, “a private conversation and that it took a week to receive the results.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, Alexis reportedly told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Shade Room</u></a> that she asked him to take a test over two years ago, and he only just now took it.

He was there for Alexis when she was pregnant with Alaiyah, so many believed that he was the father.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Fetty Wap never actually confirmed to his fans that he was the baby daddy, and when rumors started that he was not the father in 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alexis Skyy</u></a> clapped back.
