Known for his unwavering dedication as a father, husband, and friend, David’s warm and genuine presence touched the lives of all those around him. A heartfelt social media post honoring his memory described him as an exceptional individual and a pillar of strength for his family. His wife, Kate, and their daughters are currently in need of support as they navigate this challenging time.</p><p>David’s untimely demise was preceded by a battle with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a diagnosis he received after experiencing persistent back pain in September. Despite undergoing chemotherapy and aiming for a bone marrow transplant, the aggressive progression of the disease, culminating in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myeloid Sarcoma, ultimately led to his passing on October 31st.</p><p>To assist David’s family in covering medical expenses, funeral costs, and other necessities, a GoFundMe fundraiser has been set up by Karlie Mueller, aiming to raise $35,000. As of the latest update, the fundraiser has garnered $22,604 in donations. All contributions made will directly benefit the Pesicka family during this challenging period.</p><p>Golf Addiction posted on Facebook,</p><p>“We lost a good one yesterday. David was not only a friend, amazing human and hard worker. He was a great father and husband. For all of you that knew David, you know how awesome of a guy he was. Let’s show our support to Kate and his girls. You will be missed like crazy David.”</p><p>David Pesicka was celebrated within the community as a devoted and compassionate figure, renowned as the ultimate soccer dad. His vibrant spirit and genuine warmth left an indelible mark on all those fortunate enough to cross his path. Despite facing profound personal challenges, including the loss of his daughter Quinn in 2015, David remained a source of strength and inspiration for his family and community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ksaLCyJ1kqZ2jnrCsrYyonWarmaTCuXnFmqOlq12osW6wyJ6qZpmWqbKzecGaq62kmaO0bsPIrZ9mm5GjsKa%2BjKiZoqyllr%2B6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
