Frances Bean Cobain was nearly two years old when her father allegedly died by suicide and ever since, there has been a rising concern regarding what would be done with Cobain’s vast estate — most importantly, who would inherit how much, especially because Cobain failed to leave a will before his untimely demise.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>As expected, things didn’t go smoothly for the Cobain family after Courtney took the responsibility of overseeing the estate’s management, which caused a huge loss as approximately $30 million was reportedly stolen by the managers of the estates. Besides the messy financial episode, Frances had always received a hefty sum from Cobain’s estates. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Upon turning 18, she was entitled to 37 percent of her Cobain’s estate. In 2021, her total net worth was estimated at an impressive $11.2 million that she received as a part of the inheritance. As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror</a>, her monthly allowance stood at $100,000 at the time.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>However, the excessive wealth and fortune also came with their share of scandals and gossip as the conversation at the time steered towards Frances’ overspending, extravagant lifestyle and living “beyond her means despite her huge income” as admitted by the 28 years old. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on the subject later, she said</a>:</p><p>“My relationship to money is different because I didn’t earn it. It’s almost like this big, giant loan that I’ll never get rid of. I have an almost foreign relationship to it or guilt because it feels like money from somebody that I’ve never met, let alone haven’t earned myself. The one way that I was shown how to live was to live in excess, like, live beyond your means. It took me stepping away from that and getting sober in order to realize that no matter how much money you think you have, it’s not permanent”.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, her 30th birthday was filled with a major surprise, as she was given an exorbitantly vast sum of her father’s estate. Let’s shine some light on the same.</p><h2 id=h-how-much-has-frances-bean-cobain-inherited-in-2022 data-injectable=false><strong>How much has Frances Bean Cobain inherited in 2022?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Frances-Bean-Cobain-1.jpg><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>On August 18, the daughter of the Nirvana star turned 30, which coincided with added benefits including a weighty inheritance from the Nirvana estate.
