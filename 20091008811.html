It wasn't until she enrolled in the University of Western Ontario where she helped finance a degree in English Literature with modelling work and TV commercials that she discovered the acting bug, however.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_cK34aehr data-wc=85>And she was still a student when, in 1987, she had to decide whether to quit academic life for her first real acting gig in Montreal TV series Mount Royal. Despite being close to graduating the ambitious 20-year-old made the choice that was to determine her future, chucking in her degree to jet off to the Paris set where the soap was being filmed. She went on to hone her acting skills at the British American Drama Academy in London, before returning to North America.&nbsp;</p><h2>Success story</h2><p id=eLE8RlqGZ2 data-wc=57>It wasn't long, however, before the eager young thesp was on the move again, this time to New York where she attended the prestigious Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in Manhattan. Then, in 1991, aged 26, she decamped to LA where she got her big break guest starring in three episodes of the 80s hit Dallas.&nbsp;</p><p id=euwX3k3H3Q1 data-wc=77>It became clear her gamble to pursue acting had paid off when she was cast as Peter Pan's mother in the Steven Spielberg flick Hook, featuring Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams. While consolidating her reputation in movies, Kelly continued to work on the Canadian small screen, with appearances including made-for-TV production Adrift which earned her a Gemini in 1994. Other TV outings included the mystery series The Outer Limits in 1995 and 1998's The Da Vinci Inquest.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekG6jrSkGuv data-wc=48>Kerry is perhaps best known in Tinseltown, though, for her role, from 2003 to 2007, as affluent family matriarch Kirsten 'Kiki' Cohen in the hit series The OC which instantly put her on the map. She also starred in the hit crime series Perception from 2012 to 2015.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p id=emzu_R61haH data-wc=44>In 2007 Kelly announced her engagement to Canada's wealthiest man, David Thomson. She met while working on a movie project in Toronto in 2006. Despite the pair breaking off their engagement, the film and TV actress gave birth to their daughter in April 2008.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9xaWFkuKa4y7Jkq6enlrtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
