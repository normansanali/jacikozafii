That is a combined net worth with her husband of 20+ years, actor Leland Orser. Jeanne has appeared in dozens of popular movies and television shows during her career.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2014 she earned $100,000 per episode of the series Criminal Minds. She appeared in 48 episodes. Between 2006 and 2011 she appeared in 53 episodes of Big Love.</p><p>Jeanne Tripplehorn was born on June 10, 1963 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She developed an interest in performing through her father, guitarist Tom Tripplehorn. Graduating from Edison High School, Jeanne began her career as a local radio and TV host. She was educated at the University of Tulsa and the drama division of The Juilliard School in New York City. In 1991 she made her major TV debut in a supporting role in The Perfect Tribute. In 1992 she made a big splash with her second lead, in Paul Verhoeven’s thriller Basic Instinct.</p><p>In 1993 she earned a huge break when she replaced a pregnant Robin Wright in the role of Tom Cruise’s wife in the box-office smash The Firm. She has also been on Broadway in Anton Chekov’s Three Sisters opposite Amy Irving and Lili Taylor. She co-starred with Val Kilmer in a 1993 production of John Ford’s 1630s play ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore. She was next seen in “Sliding Doors” in 1998, which was a romantic comedy-drama that told parallel stories of a recently fired PR executive (Gwyneth Paltrow) whose life is radically changed by missing the subway by a few seconds. Continuing to perform in low-budget Indies rather than big budget extravaganzas, she donned blonde locks for “Steal This Movie” in 2000. Despite landing significant roles in high-profile features early in her career, she worked for years before becoming a household name on the hit cable series, “Big Love” in 2006 on HBO. She delivered an excellent supporting performance as Jacqueline Kennedy in the critically lauded “Grey Gardens” on HBO in 2009, which depicted the lives of her eccentric aunt, Big Edie (Jessica Lange), and first cousin, Little Edie (Drew Barrymore).</p><p>Personal Life: Jeanne dated Ben Stiller from 1990 to 1996. In 2000 she married actor Leland Orser. They have one child together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKVlruvsYytqaKooKGyqbvRp6pmppWperi70a2fZpqZpLSzrc%2BhsGaekZjBbq%2FAq5yeql2WxKK%2Bw6xkmqaUYrmqssRmqq2noq58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
