Boczkowski and his three children had recently moved to Pittsburgh after his first wife, Elaine Boczkowski, died in 1990. In a whirlwind courtship, Tim and Maryann agreed to marry. However, tragedy struck just eighteen months later.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cinemaholic</a>, in November 1994, Boczkowski phoned an ambulance and claimed to have found his wife unresponsive. When first responders, including the local police, arrived at the scene, they found Tim attempting to revive his wife. Maryanne was transported by ambulance to Allegheny General Hospital, as per Tim’s request, despite the fact there was another one closer. Maryanne was pronounced dead on arrival.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Suspicions arise</h2><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Local authorities grew suspicious of Boczkowski’s version of events when Maryanne’s blood alcohol level was found to be .22%, nearly twice the current legal limit of intoxication. Furthermore, her autopsy revealed that she was asphyxiated rather than drowned, as Boczkowski claimed. For further evidence, Tim had scratch marks on his arms and hands. Meanwhile, while his wife was being transported to the hospital, he remarked, “I hope they don’t try to put this on me.”</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>All combined, investigators found that Boczkowski not only murdered his second wife, but he murdered his first wife as well, in nearly the same way. Unlike Marryane, Tim’s first wife, Elaine, was found dead in a bathtub, not a hot tub, but otherwise, the details of each death are nearly identical.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where is Tim Boczkowski now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Tim Boczkowski is currently serving <a href=#>a life sentence</a> in The State Correctional Institution — Greene in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, a Supermax prison holding more than 1700 prisoners. However, before that, he served 22 years in prison in his native state, North Carolina, before he was granted parole.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>At first, Boczkowski faced the death penalty in Pennsylvania for the murder of his first wife, Elaine Boczkowski, until a court ruled that he had been illegally extradited to North Carolina to face charges for Elaine’s Boczkowski.
