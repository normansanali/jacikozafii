I fought against it for a very long time — the shape that my body’s supposed to be,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Candy&nbsp;</i></a>star confessed during a June 2022 interview with<i>&nbsp;</i><a href=#>theSkimm</a>. “[It’s] hard to be a size 10 next to a size 0. I spent many years not really eating and being very worried about what I look like.”</p><p class=p1>Lynskey, who admitted to<a href=#> struggling with an eating disorder</a> as a teenager, explained that <a href=#>suffering a miscarriage made her see her body</a> in a new light.</p><p class=p1>“A couple of years ago, I had a&nbsp;miscarriage&nbsp;and I just didn’t really recover from it physically and having a very young daughter made me really think about: ‘OK,&nbsp;I need to be kinder to myself and accepting and saying sorry to my body for what it just went through,’” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Sweet Home Alabama&nbsp;</i>actress</a> said at the time, noting that she wanted to give <a href=#>her daughter</a>, whom <a href=#>she welcomed with husband</a> <a href=#><strong>Jason Ritter</strong></a> in December 2018, a “positive example of what it looks like to <a href=#>have a mother who just is accepting her body</a>.”</p><p class=p1>While Lynskey has learned to love her curves, she’s been<a href=#> frequently criticized by others</a> for her appearance.</p><p class=p1>“Her body says life of luxury … not post apocolyptic [sic] warlord. Where is [<i>Terminator&nbsp;</i>star]&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Linda Hamilton</strong>&nbsp;</a>when you need her?” former&nbsp;<i><a href=#>America’s Next Top Model</a>&nbsp;</i>champ <a href=#><strong>Adrianne Curry</strong></a> tweeted in February 2023, alleging that Lynskey wasn’t the right fit to play Kathleen on HBO’s&nbsp;<i>The Last of Us, </i>which <a href=#>premiered one month prior</a>.</p><p class=p1>The New Zealand native, for her part, <a href=#>quickly clapped back at Curry’s claims</a>. She wrote via <a href=#>Twitter</a>: “I’m playing a person who meticulously planned & executed an overthrow of FEDRA. I am <a href=#>supposed to be SMART</a>, ma’am. I don’t&nbsp;need to be muscly. That’s what henchmen are for.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “I’m also grateful because the love and support I receive from you all is so overwhelming and powerful — I feel like we are a community and I feel very seen and loved. I’m so grateful to Craig and Neil for creating a truly new character. Someone I have never seen before. And for trusting me with her. … The thing that excited me most about doing #TheLastOfUs is that my casting suggested the possibility of a future in which people start listening to the person with the best ideas.”</p><p class=p1>Not only has <a href=#>Lynskey stood up for herself against trolls</a>, but she also has the support of the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Parenthood&nbsp;</i></a>alum, <a href=#>whom she married in 2020</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“If anyone has any further unsolicited comments about *anybody* else’s body, they can feel free to write them in permanent ink onto their own foreheads and swan dive directly into the sun,” Ritter <a href=#>tweeted in January 2022</a>, cosigning one of <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Yellowjackets&nbsp;</i>star’s</a> past clapbacks over criticism about her appearance.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to read Lynskey’s most empowering quotes about body positivity:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkuqa4wKegnmWcrru0t8Syqmaln6jBbrHMqaawnaKeu6h5waibsmWgpMCqwMivoK2xXabCsMDErGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
