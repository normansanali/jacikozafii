In season seven of <a href=#>Black Ink Crew: New York</a>, fans got to see Ceaser suit up so that he could <a href=#>take his daughter to her eighth-grade prom</a>.&nbsp;While speaking with <a href=#>In Touch</a> in 2017, Ceaser teased on if he'll ever give Cheyenne a sibling. "The funny thing is, one day I would," he revealed. "I feel like you can't just be hustlin' just to hustle. Let's say I make the Forbes and become a billionaire — I just did it just to do it? That's kind of selfish. I want to have a family and feel the love, have quality time and stuff like that."</p><p>In a February 2020 interview on <a href=#>Brunch With Tiffany</a>, Ceaser opened up about how his daughter helps dictate who he chooses to date. "My daughter, she's 15 years old, and if she don't like you then I don't like you," he told Tiffany. "My daughter is at that point where I have to bring home someone that she can actually look up to," he shared. Considering the effect Cheyenne has on Ceaser's dating life, it's clear that their father-daughter bond is tight and intact.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma29gaoBye8inqqKclWKvra3CpGSipptisLOx1qxknJ2RqK6zv4yrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmr5mptW60yKxknZmlnLW1sdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
