Instead, however, they’ll be fighting their way through a post-apocalyptic Kansas City.</p><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=907 data-injectable=true>It’s a change that seems so inconsequential, one may wonder why showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann would make it in the first place. But, on the fourth episode of HBO Max’s official The Last of Us podcast on Spotify, the duo revealed a number of subtle nuances that eventually caused them to make the decision, such as how geography would more easily play into the story’s upcoming beats, but mostly how their filming locations in Alberta didn’t lend themselves to Pittsburgh’s aesthetic as well as they would have liked.</p><p>What it came down to was the “Pittsburgh-ness” of Pittsburgh wasn’t necessarily important, and it looked closer to Kansas City. It was just harder to manufacture Pittsburgh in that place.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>In any case, we’re all too happy to continue following Joel and Ellie no matter where their journey takes them, and with a second season having <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">been confirmed</a> by HBO Max, there looks to be plenty of ground to cover.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>The Last of Us is available to stream on HBO Max, with new episodes released every Sunday until the season’s conclusion on March 12.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmo5qrpGK8p3nUrGSsoJ%2Bsv7a6zZ6prGWVrb2trcinZK2glZ6%2Fbr7EmqqoppmjtG6yzqtkq52goa6ktc2gZKmhpKnAo8HRoJ9mr5mptW63wKeqmqtdmLa1xY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
