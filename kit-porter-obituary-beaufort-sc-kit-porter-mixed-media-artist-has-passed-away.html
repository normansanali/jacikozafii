Kit, born Katharine Lea Coleman on March 21, 1983, in Wilmington, North Carolina, faced a valiant and courageous battle against breast cancer, ultimately succumbing at the age of 40. Her presence will be profoundly missed, leaving an indelible mark on the art world and the hearts of those who knew her.</p><p>Kit’s artistic journey began at the University of the South at Sewanee, Tenn., where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in painting in 2005. Her passion for art led her to become the director of Martin Gallery in Charleston from 2006 to 2011 and later the development manager of the Columbia Museum of Art. However, it was her unwavering dedication to her prolific career as a fine artist that truly defined her legacy. Porter’s artistic language was a testament to her fascination with the transformative effects of time and the environment on objects left by the sea.</p><p>Her abstract creations skillfully depicted the process of diminution, with shapes that seemed carved, softened, and shaped by the elements. Whether portraying marine debris or dissecting flowers and fields into abstraction, Kit’s paintings served as a metaphor for the fragility of the physical world, a poignant commentary on the impermanence of life. Her artistic brilliance was recognized through numerous solo and group exhibitions across the nation, earning praise in publications like Thalia Magazine and The Earth Issue.</p><p>Kit’s works found a home in private collections throughout North America and Europe. She was represented by esteemed galleries such as Anne Irwin Fine Art in Atlanta, Georgia, Dimmitt Contemporary Art in Houston, Texas, Liz Lidgett Gallery in Des Moines, Iowa, and Uprise Art in New York City, New York. A unique and personal touch to her art was the titling of her works with excerpts from the songs of her favorite band, Phish, adding an additional layer of depth and connection to her creations.</p><p>Kit Porter is survived by her devoted husband, Tristan Porter, and their two sons, Carver and Briggs. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations in Kit’s memory be directed to the Friends of Caroline Hospice Center at 329 Friends Lane, Ridgeland, S.C. 29936. As we mourn the loss of this extraordinary artist and cherished individual, let us remember Kit Porter for the beauty she brought into the world, both through her art and the love she shared with her family and friends. May her legacy continue to inspire and resonate in the hearts of those who were touched by her creativity and kindness.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwt8itZKmnoqmys3nOm6CtrZGnxm6uxJqsn6eiqXq0r4ykoK1loKS%2FtbHRZqSisJWZeq6xw6KYZpmiqba0wIyhmKxloJbAtLHDZpiwmalk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
