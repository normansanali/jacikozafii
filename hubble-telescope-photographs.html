It has had a long and illustrious career, capturing some of the most breathtaking, beautiful images in the entire universe.</p><p>With abilities far, far beyond those of the human eye, the HST captures near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light while sitting outside the blurring effect of the Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>This unique combination of abilities lets the HST -- whose principal mirror is larger than a human being at eight feet -- peer into the past and examine stars as they live, breath, and die in fiery explosions.</p><p>Humanity's knowledge of the universe would be far less expansive compared to what it is now if not for the HST. For example, astrophysicists even used the HST to determine the exact rate of the universe's expansion.</p><p>The HST will eventually fall back down to Earth, however, sometime between 2030 to 2040. Don't fret, though. Its successor -- both spiritually and scientifically -- is set to launch into space in 2018.</p><p>Its name? The James Webb Space Telescope.
