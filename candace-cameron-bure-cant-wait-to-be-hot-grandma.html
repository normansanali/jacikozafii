I can’t wait until the day I do become a grandma, whether that’s a few years or five years or 10, whatever, I love children.”</p><p>The Kind Is the New Classy author, who also shares Natasha, 22, and Maksim, 18, with her husband,<a href=#><strong> Valeri Bure</strong></a>, announced Lev’s engagement via Instagram. “She said YES,” Candace captioned the August post. “Last night my son @levvbure proposed to his beautiful girlfriend We are SO excited for these cuties!!! #Engaged!
