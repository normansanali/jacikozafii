Now, the network has announced that we will be getting a reboot, and fans are not all happy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Jana Duggar Still Follow Her Strict Family Dating Rules?</a></span></p><h2 id=checking-in-after-a-decade>Checking In After A Decade</h2><p>If&nbsp;Toddlers And Tiaras&nbsp;was considered inappropriate by some, TLC is hoping that viewers will be more open to seeing teenagers compete in the pageant business. Rather than reboot a whole new season, the network has opted to shoot an episode, checking back in with the very same children who we watched compete in beauty contests ten years ago. The theme of the special will undoubtedly be: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are these TLC reality star children okay</a>? For now, the answer to that question remains unclear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The trailer shows the now-adolescent girls as deeply entrenched in pageantry as ever before. Appearing in the promo is Maddison “Tootie” Berg, who still worries about bad beauty contest scores from back in 2010. Other contests also appear, prancing around in&nbsp;nightclub attire and throwing around singles.</p><p>So much for ever attaining a normal childhood.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘90 Day Fiancé’: Here’s Why Living In America Is Julia’s ‘Nightmare’</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-are-not-having-it>Fans Are Not Having It</h2><p>On Thursday, TLC shared a special sneak peek of the new episode to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the network’s official Instagram page</a>. And fans could not stop leaving behind their most critical comments. “Would be nice if their parents had taught them about higher education,” said one social media user. Another viewer expressed just how disturbed she was by the trailer, “This is sick.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We can only hope that the cast members are doing somewhat better, now that consistent filming has come to a close. The new spinoff episode Toddlers And Tiaras: Where Are They Now?&nbsp;will be released on Discovery Plus on January 21.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama June: Forgotten Facts About Honey Boo Boo’s June Shannon</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmq6iclKGys7%2BMoqVmrJmWv6K%2FjJ%2BYp6tdlr%2BmedSpqp6sXZavsMHTZquhnV2jsrh50Z6ZqKekZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
