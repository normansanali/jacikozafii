One person wrote: “‘None of you deserve it, but you’re worthy’ … kind of sounds like a backhanded compliment.”</p><p>Another person said “it’s [giving] backhanded compliment” to which Davis responded with: “It wasn’t meant to be. I just did not tell the story right.”</p><p>The backlash resulted in Davis posting a follow-up video where she explained that Winfrey’s comments were not to belittle the winners but rather uplift them.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“When the show was over, the audience was full of people just crying and very emotional about what we had all just experienced of being gifted the car.</p><p>“There were a lot of people saying, ‘I should sell my car and give the money to my kids.’</p><p>“Oprah overheard some of that talk and said, ‘Let me stop you right there. You don’t deserve this, and if you feel like you don’t deserve this, that’s valid.</p><p>“‘But I want you to feel worthy of it. I want you to accept it. I want you to leave here with the car and not feel bad. Release any guilt you feel about being gifted this car.’”</p><p>Davis ended the video saying: “She meant it in a really sweet way. It wasn’t a backhanded compliment.”</p><p>Another video posted on Davis’ account revealed she still has the car - that she got to choose the colour of - and kept it in mint condition.</p><p>She also said she was given a bunch of high-priced items during the giveaway including Le Creuset cookware, a burgundy Coach purse, sequinned Ugg boots and pear-drop diamond earrings that she has also held onto in the 12 years since her win.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS8sb7AoWSwoZ6bv6bFjKCgr52RrK66edaipaedomK%2FpsLEmqOsZaedrrV50Z6YpaSpYrWivM%2Bepaxlkpq1qrrDZquhnV2osKa6xKxmj4uGfYSakayFhX%2BNiHinmIKxbYdwenKMf4Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
