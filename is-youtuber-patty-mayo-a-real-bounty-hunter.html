Recommended Videos It wasn’t always like this. Mayo first courted YouTube success in 2013 as a prank video poster. In an interview with MTC, he revealed that “I had this French character called Ze Oil Boy and it was this totally ridiculous, comical, college humor…” But when the “Adpocalypse” hit back in 2016, Mayo found that new family-friendly algorithms were blitzing his edgy content."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

People liked the initial videos, and the format stuck. Mayo’s YouTube channel now has over 1 billion total views and boasts video titles like “Me vs. a 280Ib bodybuilder,” “MMA girl tries to tap me,” and “Alligators ate my fugitive” – many of which seem too absurd to be true.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association</a> even issued a statement on their website saying, “We are aware of the YouTuber Patty Mayo and his activities in Deschutes County. Mr. Mayo is not a member of law enforcement, nor affiliated in any way with any sheriff’s office in Oregon. He is an actor, and the uniform he wears is a costume.”</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>Despite this, Oregon has wide-ranging citizens’ arrest laws, including permitting arrests for misdemeanors like assault committed in somebody’s presence. So while some of the content on Mayo’s channel may be exaggerated, he still appears to have found himself in a few pretty dicey situations.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>Either way, Mayo’s videos are exciting enough to earn him over ten million subscribers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZqKrXa68tsDUm5yrZaCWwbXFjKaYsqddlnqzscClZJunpaPBunnHrqWtnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
