Angelina spends most of her time at the first house, but she likes to have options and be able to move everyone around.”</p><p>The <i>Maleficent</i> actress, 41 — who has been living with Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8, since the split — set up the first rental house before she filed for divorce from Pitt, 53, in September. Some of the amenities in the five-bedroom, 4,400-square-foot estate include a media room, in-home theater and guest home with a gym.</p><p>Prior to the shocking split, the globe-trotting family had stayed at a home owned by Pitt when they were in the L.A. area. <a href=#>The <i>Allied</i> actor </a>has digs in Los Feliz that he purchased before he started dating Jolie.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former couple recently came to an agreement to deal with their messy divorce and custody battle privately, after Pitt’s emergency request to seal the case was rejected by a court. Jolie is seeking sole physical custody, and Pitt filed for joint physical custody of the kids in response. “The parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues,” their reps told <i>Us</i> in a joint statement on Monday, January 9. “The parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappeauaq6wGahqKSZmnqzsc2tqmarlZi8r7CMoaauq5Vitq95zJqjopqlYrOwvoxsbKRlkWK6sLrToWSwbGZlgniAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
