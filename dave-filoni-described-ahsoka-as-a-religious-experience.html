Filoni may have had a few bumps along the way, but there’s nobody else at Lucasfilm we’d rather have in control of Star Wars. At this point, the man eats, breathes and sleeps in a galaxy far, far away, and it’s notable that the Disney Plus shows made without his direct involvement tend to be a little lacking (though this may change with Andor next month).</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>We should start seeing more of Ahsoka soon. Disney’s D23 Expo will take place from 9 – 11 September, and is expected to feature the official unveiling of a number of new shows. Fingers crossed that we get a teaser trailer that gives us a better idea of what the show’s about. But hey, we’d just be happy with some casting confirmation on Grand Admiral Thrawn…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylrdWeZJ%2BhnKS7qnnDnqqcqpmXsqV5wKGqqKORYq60ecBmqZ6kmZy2sMHSZpyxqJWntqa6wp5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
