You can put any type of vegetable on a vegetable crudites platter but here are some of my favorite vegetables…</p><ul><li><strong>Carrots</strong> — may use carrots sliced into sticks, heirloom carrots, or even baby carrots.</li><li><strong>Broccoli</strong> — I suggest cutting these small and using mainly the broccoli crowns.</li><li><strong>Cucumbers</strong> — I suggest using Hot House cucumbers or English cucumbers. You can leave the peel on or peel it off.</li><li><strong>Cauliflower</strong> — there are several different colors of cauliflower so I love to add purple and peach-colored cauliflower to my veggie tray.</li><li><strong>Peppers</strong> — use a variety of colors on your crudite tray. You can use red, yellow, and orange peppers for a beautiful array of colors.</li><li><strong>Rainbow Radishes</strong> — slice thin with a mandolin or sharp knife for the perfect crispy, peppery vegetable.</li><li><strong>Snap Peas</strong> — these long, fresh peas have an edible pod with peas inside. Sugar snap peas pair perfectly with ranch dip.</li><li><strong>Grape Tomatoes</strong> — bite-size tomatoes that you can easily dip and eat.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Celery</strong> — cut into long sticks and they make perfect little dippers.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Crudite-Platter-Ranch-Dip-720x735.jpg alt="Veggie Platter with Dips.

Do you want to use a large wood board? A glass tray? You can use a round, a square, a rectangular, or any type of tray you want. You will want to know the size of your tray so you know how many vegetables to buy.</li><li><strong>Buy your vegetables</strong>. Focus on a variety of colors and textures. I look to use as many colors in the rainbow as possible.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Make your dips</strong>. I love to use all different types of dips that pair perfectly with vegetables. A ranch dip is thicker than ranch dressing and is usually made with sour cream and ranch dressing powder. This pairs wonderfully with all vegetables. One of my favorite dips to put on my crudite platter is my <a href=#>popular spinach dip recipe</a>. I get asked for this recipe all of the time! You can also add a <a href=#>traditional hummus</a> with pairs well with carrots, peppers, and cucumbers.</li><li><strong>First, put your veggie dips into bowls and place them on the tray</strong>. Arrange your vegetables around the dips and try to space out the different colors of vegetables.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Cover and chill until you are ready to serve</strong>.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Crudite-Platter-2-crop-720x763.jpg alt="How to make a beautiful Crudite Platter with vegetables and dips.
