They are on better terms now than where they were a year and a half ago. It’s not perfect — it’s still a work in progress. “It’s all for the sake of their kids. The two older ones are getting to the age where they can start reading things about their parents on the internet, so they are really careful about what they say about one another or what they post. You certainly won’t see either one trash talk the other in the media.”</p><p>The actor and the Transformers star <a href=#>split in May 2020</a>. The Tennessee native moved on with rapper <a href=#><strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong></a>, and the duo <a href=#>got engaged in January 2022</a>.</p><p>Green, for his part, moved on with Burgess.
