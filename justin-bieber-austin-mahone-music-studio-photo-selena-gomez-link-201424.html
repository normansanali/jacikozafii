"New music #YMCMB," the worldwide sensation captioned the pic.</p><p>Mahone shared the same snapshot and <a href=#>gushed</a>, "What an amazing song last night..The world isn't ready!" (The 17-year-old star signed with Young Money last September, joining artists like <strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a></strong>, <strong>Lil Wayne</strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Drake</a></strong> on the label.) Birdman also chimed in from the recording session Tuesday and wrote, "Studio flow with tha yung future of music get ready YMCMB."</p><p>"Justin happened to be in the same studio with Birdman," a second source explains of their encounter. "Austin was in the studio next door recording a song that Justin wrote," the insider adds of Bieber, whose songwriting credits include many of his personal hits, like "Baby" and "One Less Lonely Girl."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>As previously reported</a> in January, Gomez, 21, and Mahone were briefly "seeing each other" after being set up by mutual pal <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>. Though the two kept a low profile during their brief fling, they were seen leaving the Beats Music on Jan. 24.</p><p>In early March, Gomez and Bieber reunited for the umpteenth time — first <a href=#>at a Texas Starbucks</a> and days later, during a SXSW event in Austin, where Bieber serenaded Gomez.</p><p>The "Heartbreaker" singer later shared a homemade video of himself, <a href=#>dirty dancing</a> with the Disney Channel alum, which he promptly deleted via Instagram. And last Thursday, March 27, <a href=#>Gomez was subpoenaed</a> outside an L.A. convenience store to testify in one of the "Boyfriend" crooner's lawsuits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGuq6Seu26uyJ6ZnqpdlsK0wMinZKaZmKS7pnnMrqqim12owbawyKhkqaCfqbxuv8SlnKeZXZy8rrHZZqOipptif3F9k2traA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
