The 31-year-old Connecticut resident recently left a mark in history by becoming a Guinness World Records title holder for having the biggest mouth out of all women on the planet.
Ramdell's rise to fame started on TikTok, where she now has over 1.7 million followers. She opened her account on the platform last year as a way to stay creative during the COVID-19 pandemic."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, there was only one way to find out.</p><p class=dh>Ramdell followed her fans' suggestion and contacted Guinness World Records. She also scheduled an appointment with Dr. Elke Cheung at her local dentist's office in South Norwalk.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MAKING IT OFFICIAL</strong></p><p class=dh>With an official adjudicator present, the dentist used digital calipers to measure the length and width of Ramdell's mouth, and the results confirmed the TikTok users' suspicions.</p><p class=dh>Ramdell's mouth stretches up to 6.52 centimeters, and after learning that she was a world record titleholder, she was over the moon, especially since she used to feel insecure about it.
